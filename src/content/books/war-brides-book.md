# War Brides

The eighth book in the **Saving Ceraste** series brings opposites-attract romance with epic bridezilla moments as war looms on the horizon.

## Synopsis

Trinh: Several months ago, I was lying in a hospital bed, dying of cancer, when a man showed up to offer me a deal. An alien race called the Cerasteans had lost all of their women and were in danger of dying out. It turns out that they are compatible with human women. Lucky us! If I agreed to join their Bride Program, the aliens could use their technology to save my life.

Now I am on an alien spaceship living my best life. What can I say? They made me an offer I couldn't refuse. I vowed to live every day to the fullest and love living carefree on an alien spaceship. Each day is filled with amazing new friends and plenty of adventure. The only dark spot in my days is a stick-in-the-mud, rule-loving alien who’s always out to restrict my plans. What's wrong with wanting to take care of my girls and have a little fun along the way?

L’Corte: As the Director of the Bride Program, it is my duty to make sure the human bride volunteers on our ship are safe, secure, and thriving in their new lives. It is a job I take very seriously. Everyone respects my authority on the ship. Everyone, except for one bride volunteer who believes that rules are made to be broken, and regulations are easily defeated obstacles. How can Trinh not understand that regulations are vital to a smoothly operating system?

With war on the horizon, will Trinh and L’Corte be able to find common ground in order to plan a massive wedding? As they find a new understanding of one another through the shared goal of helping their people, sparks start to fly.

# Lily Saves An Alien

The first book in the **Koko's Harbor for Wayward Fated Mates** series launches a new paranormal romance world where magical small towns help lost souls find their perfect supernatural matches.

## Synopsis

Lilith Blackwell needs a fresh start. After finally dumping her loser ex-boyfriend, Lily is on her way to move back in with her beloved Aunt Zizi. Just until she gets her feet back under her.

While crossing the country, Lily's path takes an unexpected detour when she stumbles upon the enchanting town of Lublin Harbor during its springtime 'love' festival. A bizarre twist of fate strands Lily in the midst of the festivities, leading her to the sanctuary of a secluded cabin owned by Koko, the town's enigmatic mayor and bakery shop owner.

Little does Lily realize that her brief respite will soon be turned upside down when an alien spaceship crash lands almost on her doorstep.

As Lily rescues and nurses an injured alien named Ravok back to health, a bond blossoms between them, transcending language and stirring feelings in Lily deeper than any she has experienced before. But as their connection grows, so does the mystery surrounding their serendipitous meeting and the danger posed by those still searching for Ravok.

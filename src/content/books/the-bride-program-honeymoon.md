# The Bride Program Honeymoon

A novella continuation of Maya and D'Avii's story from **The Bride Program**.

## Synopsis

Just when Maya and D'Avii thought they could enjoy their honeymoon in peace, a medical emergency calls them back to duty. Children from both species are falling ill with symptoms that don't match any known diseases.

As they investigate, Maya and D'Avii must learn to work together not just as husband and wife, but as a true medical team. Their different approaches to medicine—Maya's intuitive human techniques and D'Avii's methodical Cerastean protocols—might hold the key to solving the mystery.

But solving the case is only half the battle. Their new marriage must survive the pressure of a life-threatening crisis and the realization that their lives will always involve putting others' needs first.

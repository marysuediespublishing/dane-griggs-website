# The Chancellor's Pilot

The ninth book in the **Saving Ceraste** series brings the epic confrontation that fans have been waiting for, with political intrigue, galactic stakes, and a love story that ties everything together.

## Synopsis

Zoe: Being a fighter pilot in the United States Air Force is all I ever wanted. That is, until I saw the Cerastean's alien spaceship. I was first in line to volunteer when the Cerasteans offered to train human pilots to fly their dart fighters. Now we’ve just discovered that another alien species wants to destroy all Cerasteans—and humans along with them. It looks like my flying skills are about to be put to the test.

L'Forn, Cerastean Leader: There are less than five thousand of my people left in the universe, and it’s my responsibility to keep them safe. Now a new threat looms, jeopardizing my race and the people of Earth, who have given us a new home. The Ostiums and their crazed queen want to destroy everything I hold dear. I need to focus on defeating this enemy, but a certain female warrior has caught my attention.

As two people whose duty to serve comes first, can Zoe and L’Forn give in to their attraction? Can love blossom with the threat of war hanging over their heads? Can Zoe finally get L’Forn to relax and have some fun?

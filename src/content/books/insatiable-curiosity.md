# Insatiable Curiosity

The fifth book in the **Saving Ceraste** series follows an engineer's dream of exploring space.

## Synopsis

Ally Chen has always dreamed of being an astronaut, but her eye condition grounded those dreams before they could take flight. When the Bride Program offers her a chance to live in space and study alien technology, she jumps at the opportunity—even if it means finding an alien husband.

She's matched with Zek'tar, a brilliant Cerastean engineer who's equally passionate about spacecraft design. While Ally is fascinated by Cerastean technology, Zek'tar is intrigued by human engineering innovations that he considers "charmingly inefficient but surprisingly effective."

As they work together to design hybrid human-Cerastean spacecraft, their professional collaboration deepens into personal connection. But when their experimental designs are needed for a dangerous rescue mission, both must decide if their growing love is worth risking their lives for.

# The Bride Program Honeymoon

The fourth book in the **Saving Ceraste** series takes our favorite couples on their first vacation together—where relaxation quickly turns into intergalactic politics and shocking discoveries.

## Synopsis

I'm getting married to my dream alien!!!

Okay, I'm really choosing L'Arc in the Presenting Ceremony, but that doesn't have the same ring to it. Either way, this is the start to the rest of my life with my mate. I am madly in love, and we get to go on a honeymoon on a lush tropical paradise in another galaxy! The Cerasteans have been crazy-busy, so it's nice we can get away for a week. Several of my bride volunteers friends are joining us on the trip to Xerini—the dulci home world. I can't wait to hit the beaches with Maya, Serena, Chelsea and our Cerastean mates. I'll be sure we have plenty of alone time too. It's going to be the best trip ever!

Come along for the Presenting Ceremony, tropical paradise adventures, and shocking plot twists that will set up the rest of the series.

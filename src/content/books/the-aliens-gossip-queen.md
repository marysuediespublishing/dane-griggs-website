# The Alien's Gossip Queen

The sixth book in the **Saving Ceraste** series explores the challenges of diplomatic relations and privacy.

## Synopsis

Rosa Martinez has always been the person everyone comes to with their problems. As the station's communications specialist, she knows everyone's businessâ€”and she's good at using that knowledge to help solve conflicts and improve relationships.

When she's matched with Vel'dan, the most intensely private Cerastean she's ever met, Rosa faces her biggest challenge yet. Vel'dan values discretion above all else and finds Rosa's natural curiosity about others deeply unsettling.

As they work together on sensitive diplomatic communications between species, Rosa must learn when to listen and when to give others space, while Vel'dan discovers that sometimes sharing your troubles can lighten the load. But when a communications breakdown threatens the entire Bride Program, their different approaches to information might be exactly what's needed to save the day.

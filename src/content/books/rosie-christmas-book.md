# A Rosie Christmas

A heartwarming holiday special that returns to the beloved Saving Ceraste universe with new characters experiencing the magic of Christmas traditions and finding love during the season of giving.

## Synopsis

Rosie Simson is committed to serving as the Human Bride Liaison on a Cerastean mothership. With bride volunteer Trinh's help, Rosie wants to plan an amazing holiday extravaganza for all the brides who will be spending their first Christmas away from Earth. All the while still navigating the ship's crew through tumultuous situations including an aggressive parent demanding his daughter's return, a ship-wide issue of survivor's guilt and trauma, and preparing a crew for an expedition back to the Ceraste home world to rehabilitate the planet – all while never losing sight of her professionalism.

Her role of guiding human brides into Cerastean society takes a romantic turn when she develops a deep affection for D'Brac, a Cerastean Warrior who becomes her protector. However, Rosie knows that the Cerastean aliens all want to have children – it's the point of the Bride Program, after all – and as a woman in her fifties… Well, that ship has sailed. D'Brac couldn't possibly be interested in her romantically. Or could he?

Amid the chaos, Rosie finds solace in her growing bond with D'Brac. Taking advantage of the holiday season, they plan to bring Earth's Christmas traditions aboard the mothership, allowing human culture to be experienced in Cerastean society.

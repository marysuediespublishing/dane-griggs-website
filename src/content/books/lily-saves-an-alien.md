# Lily Saves An Alien

The first book in the **Koko's Harbor for Wayward Fated Mates** series introduces a world where Earth's oceans hold more secrets than anyone imagined.

## Synopsis

Dr. Lily Chen has dedicated her life to marine biology, finding solace in the predictable rhythms of ocean life after losing her family in a car accident. When she discovers a badly injured alien in the tide pools near her remote research station, her quiet world is turned upside down.

Kael isn't just any alienâ€”he's a Kraken, a species evolved from Earth's ancient cephalopods who left the planet millennia ago. Now he's crashed back to Earth, wounded and hunted by his own people for crimes he didn't commit.

As Lily nurses Kael back to health, she discovers that the tentacled alien's intelligence and gentleness contrast sharply with his fearsome appearance. But when other Krakens arrive searching for him, Lily must choose between her safe, predictable life and an impossible love that could cost them both everything.

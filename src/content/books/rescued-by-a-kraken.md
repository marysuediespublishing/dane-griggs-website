# Rescued By A Kraken

The second book in the **Koko's Harbor for Wayward Fated Mates** series dives deeper into the hidden world of the Krakens.

## Synopsis

Dr. Sophie Martinez has spent years studying ancient underwater civilizations, but she never expected to meet one face-to-face. When her submersible is damaged during a deep-sea expedition, she's rescued by Thal'ek, a member of the aquatic species she's been researching.

Thal'ek is Kraken royalty, next in line to rule his people's hidden kingdom beneath the Pacific. He should turn Sophie over to his father's guardsâ€”humans who discover their civilization are usually mind-wiped and returned to the surface with no memory of what they've seen.

But something about the passionate archaeologist makes Thal'ek hesitate. As Sophie recovers in the Kraken city, she and Thal'ek discover that their species' histories are more intertwined than either imagined. When political tensions in the Kraken kingdom threaten both their lives, they must choose between duty and a love that could bridge two worlds.

# Marshmallow

The seventh book in the **Saving Ceraste** series brings us the long-awaited romance between Sara and General D'Annon—a gruff, tough hero with a soft gooey marshmallow center.

## Synopsis

Follow Sara and General D'Annon as what should have been a simple trip to get Sara home turns into the adventure of a lifetime.

**Sara**: I am heartbroken to quit the Bride Program. Momma needs me to return home and take care of her after a recent heart attack. Even though I had no intention of ever becoming a bride to one of the Cerastean aliens, I don't want to leave. The mothership is the first place I have felt safe in a very long time. I will miss the feeling of security and all my friends. I may even miss one gruff, annoying, overprotective alien general.

**General D'Annon**: I've watched and worried over Sara for months. Like all Cerasteans, I can smell emotions. Sadness and fear were Sara's constant companions in the early days of her arrival on the mothership. Now that she has to return to Earth, the scent of Sara's sadness and fear are back. I vow to escort Sara home and make sure she is safe.

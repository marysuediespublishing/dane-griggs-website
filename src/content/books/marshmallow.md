# Marshmallow

The seventh book in the **Saving Ceraste** series brings sweetness to the stars.

## Synopsis

Pastry chef Mia Santos joined the Bride Program to escape her overbearing family's expectations, but she didn't expect to fall for a Cerastean who's never experienced the simple pleasure of dessert. Zeth'kar's species evolved without developing a taste for sweetness, making Mia's greatest passion completely foreign to him.

What starts as cooking lessons becomes a journey of cultural exchange and discovery. As Mia teaches Zeth'kar about the art of baking and the comfort of sweet treats, he introduces her to Cerastean cuisine with its complex umami flavors and nutritional precision.

But when Mia's family arrives on the station demanding she return to Earth, both she and Zeth'kar must decide if their love is sweet enough to overcome the bitter taste of family disapproval and cultural differences.

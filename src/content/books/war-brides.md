# War Brides

The eighth book in the **Saving Ceraste** series brings conflict and passion to the forefront.

## Synopsis

Lieutenant Ana Rodriguez never expected her military background to be relevant to the Bride Program, but when a hostile alien species discovers the human-Cerastean alliance, suddenly every bride becomes a potential target. Matched with Riv'thak, a former Cerastean military strategist, Ana finds herself planning defenses instead of wedding ceremonies.

As attacks intensify, the Bride Program participants must prove their relationships are strong enough to withstand not just cultural differences, but actual warfare. Ana and Riv'thak's tactical skills complement each other perfectly in battle, but they struggle to find the same harmony in their personal relationship.

When Ana volunteers for a dangerous reconnaissance mission, Riv'thak must choose between his protective instincts and his respect for her abilities. Their love will either be forged stronger in the fires of war, or destroyed by the very conflict that brought them together.

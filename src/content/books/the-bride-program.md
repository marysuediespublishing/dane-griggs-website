# The Bride Program

Welcome to the world of **Saving Ceraste**, where humans and Cerasteans work together to save both their species through an innovative bride exchange program.

## Synopsis

Dr. Maya Patel has dedicated her life to medicine, but when Earth's population crisis reaches critical levels, she volunteers for the controversial Bride Program. The promise? A perfect genetic match with an alien husband and the chance to help save both species.

When she's paired with D'Avii, a brilliant Cerastean physician, Maya thinks she's found her happily ever after. The gorgeous alien doctor is everything she could want in a partner - intelligent, kind, and devastatingly attractive in that uniquely Cerastean way.

There's just one problem: D'Avii seems completely uninterested in the romantic side of their arrangement.

As Maya navigates life on the Cerastean space station, she begins to question everything she thought she knew about love, compatibility, and what it means to build a life with someone from another world. Can she win over her reluctant alien husband, or did the program's algorithms make a terrible mistake?

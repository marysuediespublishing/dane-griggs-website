# Insatiable Curiosity

The fifth book in the **Saving Ceraste** series celebrates intellectual curiosity, engineering passion, and finding someone who appreciates your need to understand how everything works.

## Synopsis

Ally has wanted to be an astronaut for as long as she can remember, but an eye condition made that dream impossible. So when she finds herself on a Cerastean ship surrounded by the most advanced technology in the galaxy, she can't help herself—she HAS to know how everything works.

After being caught sneaking into engineering one too many times, Ally gets assigned to work with Cerastean Scientist L'Zaen to re-engineer an Ostium weapon. It's literally a dream job, even if it comes with serious responsibilities.

L'Zaen is everything an alien scientist should be—brilliant, dedicated, and completely fascinated by problems that would make other people's heads spin. When he meets Ally, he discovers something wonderful: a human whose insatiable curiosity makes every day an adventure.

When their work earns them an invitation to a festival on the Hisk homeworld, Ally's greatest dream finally comes true—she gets to explore space and experience alien cultures firsthand.

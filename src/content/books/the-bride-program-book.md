# The Bride Program

The first book in the **Saving Ceraste** series that launched Dane Griggs' commitment to writing strong heroines who solve problems with their brains, not just their beauty.

## Synopsis

Would you marry an alien to save the life of a family member?

Maya Arnold was leading an ordinary life, working a boring job, helping care for her sick sister and watching too much TV with her mom on the old couch. Then the aliens arrived.

Offering a cure for cancer in exchange for women willing to volunteer as brides, the Cerasteans dangle the one carrot Maya cannot resist: a way to save her sister. Follow Maya as she joins the Bride Program, finds adventure, friendship and love.

Commander Dâ€™Avii and the surviving Cerastean males have been searching the galaxy for a new home since the mysterious destruction of their planet. Finding Earth and its women was a miracle.

Like most Cerasteans, Commander D'Avii finds humans to be fascinating creatures -- none more so than bride volunteer Maya. His attraction to her is instant and intense. Still he knows Maya can never choose him, a warrior, with so many higher-caste scientists seeking their own mates. To do so would shame the scientists and tear the last of his people apart, yet he aches at the loss of something he never even had.

## What Makes This Book Special

- **Class Conflict**: Cerastean society's caste system creates realistic obstacles to romance
- **Found Family**: The bride volunteers become genuine sisters through shared experience
- **No Mary Sue Promise**: Maya has flaws, makes mistakes, and grows throughout the story
- **World-Building**: Detailed Cerastean culture that feels authentic and lived-in

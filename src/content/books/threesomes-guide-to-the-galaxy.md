# Threesome's Guide to the Galaxy

The third book in the **Saving Ceraste** series explores the complexities of Cerastean bonding rituals and unconventional relationships.

## Synopsis

Dr. Lin Rodriguez thought she understood the Bride Program's matching algorithms until she's assigned to not one, but two Cerastean partners. Thor'dak and his bonded partner Vel'tar explain that some Cerasteans form triadic bonds for emotional and genetic stability.

What starts as a confusing cultural exchange becomes an exploration of love, commitment, and the different ways sentient beings form lasting relationships. Lin must navigate not only her feelings for both aliens but also the complex social dynamics of a species where some individuals are meant to love in groups.

As the three of them work together on a critical research project, Lin discovers that sometimes the heart knows what it wants even when the mind struggles to understand.

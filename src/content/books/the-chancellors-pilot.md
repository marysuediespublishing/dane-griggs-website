# The Chancellor's Pilot

The ninth and final book in the **Saving Ceraste** series brings the alliance full circle.

## Synopsis

Sage Williams has spent her life trying to escape her father's political shadow as Earth's Chancellor, but when the Bride Program needs a high-profile success story, she becomes the most watched participant in the program's history. Matched with Mor'dan, son of the Cerastean Chancellor, their relationship carries the weight of two worlds.

Both Sage and Mor'dan are skilled pilots who prefer the freedom of space to the constraints of politics, but their union is about more than personal compatibilityâ€”it's meant to cement the alliance between their species. As they navigate public scrutiny and family expectations, they must also deal with their genuine feelings for each other.

When political tensions threaten to tear apart everything the Bride Program has built, Sage and Mor'dan must choose between their duty to their people and their right to love freely. Their decision will determine not just their own future, but the fate of human-Cerastean relations for generations to come.

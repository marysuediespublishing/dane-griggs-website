# Bedside Manners for Aliens

The second book in the **Saving Ceraste** series explores workplace romance in the most important job of all—saving lives through inter-species medical cooperation.

## Synopsis

Serena: Aliens have landed on Earth and offered a cure for cancer in exchange for human brides to save their race. The program has led to protests and, increasingly, violence. But as a hematologist specializing in leukemia, I still jump at the chance to work with the Cerastean doctors to help cure patients. I’m assigned to work with Physician L’Vect who is well—he’s different. He’s gruff, clueless, occasionally rude, and scaring the crap out of our human patients. But there is something about him that I can’t seem to resist. When L’Vect asks me to teach him to better understand humans, I jump at the chance to help. Plus, it allows me to get closer to this intriguing alien.

L’Vect: I have always been socially inept. I do not pick up on social cues that come effortlessly to others. Now as I try to interact with my new human patients and fellow co-workers, I find that I am even worse with the humans than I am with my own people. I did not believe it was possible. I do not pick up on human’s most basic social cues. I want to help my patients, but all I can scent is their fear when I speak with them. Luckily, the one human who seems to understand me, Dr. Serena Salcedo, has offered to instruct me in ‘bedside manners.’

As Serena and L’Vect begin to learn and understand each other’s differences and similarities, feelings begin to develop between them. However, forces outside of their control are conspiring to tear them apart.

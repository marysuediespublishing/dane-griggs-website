# The Alien's Gossip Queen

The sixth book in the **Saving Ceraste** series asks the important question: Could you actually love something—or someone—more than juicy gossip?

## Synopsis

Janet accepted a job at a Cerastean healing center with one goal: focus on the work at hand, saving patients from cancer. And maybe some gossip. There is nothing she loves more than juicy gossip.

It turns out that a medical facility filled with humans and aliens creates a treasure trove of romance, scandal, and fabulous rumors. This facility is feeding her Gossip Queen soul.

But there might actually be something, or someone, she could love more. He's sweet, protective, loves dogs, has a body to die for... And he's an alien.

D'Xurrl: As head of security for Deerfield Medical facility, the humans I am tasked with protecting certainly keep me on my toes. I've learned the word "shenanigan" since coming to Earth, and I have found that humans encapsulate the term perfectly. One vivacious human, in particular, has captured my attention with her sweet scent, her love of gossip, and her curvy body.

When events beyond their control test D'Xurrl and Janet's budding romance, can their relationship withstand the turbulence?

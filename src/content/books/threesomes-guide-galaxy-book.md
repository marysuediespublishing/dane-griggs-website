# Threesome's Guide to the Galaxy

The third book in the **Saving Ceraste** series explores healing from trauma through unconventional love and the power of patient, devoted partners.

## Synopsis

n space, no one can hear you moan.

Ever since avoiding death at the hands of a mad scientist, Chelsea has been hiding in the ductwork of an alien space station. When two new victims are brought in, Chelsea sees her chance to escape. Should she take this opportunity to get away or attempt to rescue the two sexy aliens from the scientist's clutches? What's a girl to do?

Take a journey with Chelsea, D'Rett and L'Tarne as they attempt to flee and return to Earth. Their mission is to escape and get vital information to their people. They have a beat-up space ship, bad guys on their tail, new planets to explore and a mutual attraction they are trying to resist.

Note: Menage stories are not everyone's cup of tea and I was worried about alienating (no pun intended) some of my fans. To address this issue, I decided to write books 3 and 4 so that you could skip this book and still follow the overall storyline of Saving Ceraste in book 4 The Bride Program Honeymoon.

## What Makes This Book Special

- **Trauma-Informed Romance**: Realistic portrayal of recovery from kidnapping
- **Patient Heroes**: D'Rett and L'Tarne respect Chelsea's boundaries and healing timeline
- **Unconventional Structure**: Menage relationship that serves the character's emotional needs
- **Cerastean Culture**: Explores how their mating bonds can accommodate multiple partners

## Content Notes

- Menage relationship (MFM) with emotional focus
- Healing-centered romance rather than instant attraction
- High heat level with emphasis on emotional safety and consent

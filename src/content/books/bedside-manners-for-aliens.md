# Bedside Manners For Aliens

The second book in the **Saving Ceraste** series explores the challenges of inter-species medical practice and romance.

## Synopsis

Dr. Zara Chen has always been at the top of her field, but nothing prepared her for the Bride Program's assignment: teaching human medical techniques to alien doctors while learning their advanced healing methods. When she's paired with Keth'ran, a brilliant but arrogant Cerastean surgeon, sparks fly—and not the good kind.

Keth'ran believes Cerastean medicine is superior in every way, while Zara knows human techniques have saved countless lives. As they're forced to work together to develop hybrid medical protocols, their professional rivalry slowly transforms into something neither expected.

But when a medical crisis threatens both species, Zara and Keth'ran must put aside their differences and combine their knowledge to save lives—including their own relationship.

# Rescued By A Kraken

The second book in the **Koko's Harbor for Wayward Fated Mates** series explores what happens when a woman afraid of water meets her sea monster match in the magical town of Lublin Harbor.

## Synopsis

Rose Ashford needs a change of scenery.

Seeking inspiration for her art and a break from the desert heat, Rose embarks on a vacation to the quaint coastal town of Lublin Harbor. What starts as a simple getaway soon becomes an adventure beyond her wildest dreams.

Guided by the charming and mysterious Levi, Rose discovers the magic of New England’s rugged coastline. But as she explores tide pools and lighthouses, she can’t shake the feeling that there’s more to this town – and to Levi – than meets the eye.

When an unexpected storm strikes during a kayaking trip, Rose finds herself at the center of an encounter that defies explanation. Saved by a creature straight out of legend, Rose finds herself drawn into a hidden world beneath the waves. As she unravels the secrets of Lublin Harbor, she must navigate the unfamiliar waters of newfound love and mythical beings.

In Lublin Harbor where the impossible becomes possible, Rose finds herself torn between two worlds – and two extraordinary beings. As her vacation nears its end, she faces an impossible choice: return to the familiarity of her old life or dive into the magical realm she’s uncovered. Yet, as the departure date looms, Rose grapples with the real question burning in her heart: can she bear to leave behind Levi – and the mysterious kraken who’s captured her imagination?

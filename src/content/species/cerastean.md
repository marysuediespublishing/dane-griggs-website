name: Cerastean
slug: cerastean
description: >-
  The Cerasteans are a humanoid alien species from the desert world of Ceraste,
  distinguished by both their physical traits and their cultural history. They
  are typically larger than humans, with men towering over most people, and they
  possess striking golden eyes with vertical slit pupils, small horns at the
  temples, and, in some cases, patterned scales (such as tan and brown diamond
  markings on the forearms). Their appearance often gives them a dangerous,
  almost viper-like look, yet many are considered attractive by human standards.
  Their skin tones range through tans and browns, evolved to blend into their
  arid homeworld. They also have forked tongues used to detect scent and
  pheromones, making them highly sensitive to emotions and lies.


  Cerastean society once had multiple castes, but the destruction of their planet wiped out their ruling and female populations. Only the Warrior caste (names beginning with D’), who are physically larger and protective by nature, and the Scientist caste (names beginning with L’), who are smaller, cerebral, and analytical, remain. Warriors serve as protectors and soldiers, while Scientists now hold the highest ranks. Their original females were smaller than human women, fierce, and venomous, but unable to survive long-term space travel – none were aboard the fleet when catastrophe struck.


  The Bride Program was born of desperation: with their women gone, the Cerasteans faced extinction. Their exploration fleet, which had been searching for a new home, encountered Earth and discovered that human women are biologically compatible. In exchange for advanced technology and cures for diseases like leukemia and lymphoma, they asked for female volunteers willing to form partnerships and have children with Cerastean men. Volunteers may choose their partners, leave the program at any time, and are promised respectful treatment.


  In nature, Cerasteans tend to be honorable, respectful, and highly protective of those under their care. While their predatory heritage and imposing appearance can be intimidating, many display warmth, curiosity, and a strong sense of duty. Warriors often exhibit a protective instinct toward humans, while Scientists show fascination with human culture, resilience, and adaptability. Having focused for so long on survival, contact with humanity has rekindled their capacity for joy, humor, and deeper connection.

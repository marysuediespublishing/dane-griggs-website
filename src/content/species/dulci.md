name: Dulci
slug: dulci
description: >-
  The Dulci are small, squirrel- or chipmunk-like creatures covered in plush,
  silky fur, with bright, intelligent eyes and nimble paws made for climbing,
  grasping, and quick movement. Their most remarkable trait is their natural
  camouflage – their fur can shift in color and pattern to match their
  surroundings so precisely that they can seem to vanish in plain sight. This
  ability makes them exceptional at avoiding predators and moving undetected, a
  skill highly prized by those who keep them as companions or use them as
  lookouts.


  Dulci are curious, clever, and highly social with those they trust. They bond closely with their chosen companions, showing a mix of affection and playfulness, but remain cautious and quick to hide around strangers. Their sharp senses and quick reflexes make them excellent scouts and alert guardians.


  They originate from the lush, tropical world of Xerini, a planet rich in dense jungles, flowering plants, and warm coastal regions. Xerini’s abundance of fruit, nuts, and edible vegetation provides an ideal environment for the Dulci, and their camouflage allows them to move safely among the planet’s vibrant foliage. In the wild, they make their homes in hollows, woven nests, or concealed burrows, often hidden high in the canopy or tucked within thick undergrowth. The combination of abundant resources and natural cover has shaped them into agile, resourceful survivors.

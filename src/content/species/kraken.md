  Their society is organized as a hereditary monarchy, ruled by the Kraken King
  and Queen and supported by a royal court that oversees warriors, hunters,
  artisans, and keepers of sacred traditions. Status is determined by martial
  skill, loyalty to the crown, and devotion to their god, Thassalor, the
  primordial embodiment of the sea’s will.


  Krakens are shapeshifters with three distinct forms. In their full kraken form, they are immense leviathan-like creatures with muscular mantles and tentacles stretching over a hundred feet, capable of crushing prey and matching even giant squid in ferocity. The scout form is a smaller, more streamlined kraken body used for navigating palace corridors, conducting reconnaissance, and moving through confined spaces. Finally, they possess a human form, which most krakens rarely use, believing humans to be fragile and inferior. Transforming between kraken forms is natural, but shifting into human form is taxing for pure-bloods. Half-human krakens, however, are uniquely adept at changing shape, especially into human form, though they face suspicion, hostility, and often exile for their mixed heritage. In the eyes of most, their existence is a stain on kraken purity, though some leaders recognize their adaptability as a strength.


  Physically, krakens in their aquatic forms combine the sleek predatory power of a cephalopod with the intelligence and precision of an apex hunter. Their skin is patterned with shifting bioluminescent markings, their eyes are large and adapted to pierce the blackness of the abyss, and their bodies are built to withstand the crushing pressures of the Midnight Zone. Each tentacle is lined with toothed suckers for gripping prey, and their movements are as fluid and deadly as the currents they command.


  Thassalor, the great kraken god, is a colossal and unfathomable being said to dwell in the deepest ocean trenches. His form is an endless mass of titanic tentacles, glowing patterns, and ancient eyes that seem to contain the weight of eons. He embodies the ocean’s duality, granting life and abundance while holding the power to unleash destruction on a scale beyond mortal comprehension. Worship of Thassalor is central to kraken identity, with sacred hunts, the defense of holy waters, and loyalty to the monarchy considered acts of devotion.


  The kraken’s abilities are formidable. They possess immense strength, speed, and agility in water, along with heightened senses that allow them to detect pressure shifts, subtle vibrations, and chemical traces in the currents. They can navigate in absolute darkness and communicate through a complex language of sonar pulses, body posture, and bioluminescent signals. Their habitat ranges from warm, sheltered reefs where their young are raised to the crushing, lightless depths where the royal court and the eldest krakens dwell. As apex predators, they maintain the balance of ocean life, upholding an honor-bound culture that values order and the stability of the seas as much as their own survival.

name: Human
slug: human
description: The galaxy’s most unpredictable import. We have a remarkable talent
  for stumbling into situations that no sane species would consider survivable –
  only to walk out with a monster for a boyfriend, an alien for a husband, or
  both. Give us an interstellar peace treaty, and we’ll turn it into a rom-com.
  Drop us into a political conspiracy, and somehow we’ll emerge mated, slightly
  bruised, and with a pet creature that everyone swears is dangerous. We fall in
  love in the middle of firefights, flirt during diplomatic negotiations, and
  collect shenanigans like other species collect war medals. If there’s trouble
  to be found, we’ll trip over it  – probably in heels or flip flops  – and if
  there’s someone tall, dangerous, and completely inappropriate nearby, we’ll be
  head over heels before the dust settles. The galaxy may never understand us,
  but it will never be bored while we’re around.

physicalTraits: Wildly variable skin tones and hair colors, eyes in every shade
  from “boring brown” to “are those even real?”, two legs and two arms but
  somehow still trip over flat surfaces, hair that grows inconveniently
  everywhere except where we want it, smiles used as both a greeting and a
  warning, a baffling range of heights and builds, fashion choices from
  “practical” to “this will definitely get me killed in space”
cultureNotes: Compulsive about sticking our noses where they don’t belong, prone
  to falling in love with monsters and aliens during life-threatening
  situations, treat rules as flexible suggestions, make jokes at the worst
  possible time, turn political negotiations into dating opportunities, can turn
  any object into a game, turning wild and dangerous creatures into pets, find
  trouble like it’s a competitive sport
biologyNotes: Highly adaptable but somehow also constantly injured, hearts that
  beat faster for danger *and* for romance, extreme stamina for shenanigans, can
  survive on questionable food and caffeine alone, emotional responses include
  blushing, laughing, and making even worse decisions, mate-bonding process
  often includes awkward flirting and wildly inappropriate timing

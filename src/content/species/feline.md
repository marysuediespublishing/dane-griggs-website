name: Feline
slug: feline
description: The undisputed monarchs of every household they deign to inhabit.
  Officially classified as “pets,” but operating more like tiny, furry dictators
  with an unlimited supply of charm. They are demanding, imperious, and
  gloriously self-absorbed – yet somehow still the baby. Their days are
  carefully divided between sleeping like a decorative throw pillow, plotting
  world domination from atop the fridge, and reminding their humans that food
  bowls must never, under any circumstances, be less than full. They communicate
  primarily through tail flicks, judgmental stares, and strategic 3am stampedes.
  Resistance to their demands is futile; they will sit on your laptop, your
  book, or your dignity until you comply. In short, cats don’t live with us – we
  live in service to them.

physicalTraits: Compact, flexible bodies built for both elegance and chaos, fur
  in every conceivable color and pattern, eyes that can pierce your soul at
  twenty paces, tails that double as mood indicators and whips of judgment,
  retractable claws for affection *and* revenge, purr engines with variable
  volume, faces capable of conveying disdain without a single word
cultureNotes: Universally acknowledged as the true rulers over humans, expect
  royal treatment at all times, demand food precisely when it is inconvenient,
  sassy enough to ignore commands but needy enough to sit on your chest at 3am,
  treat expensive toys as garbage and garbage as priceless treasures, act like
  they own the house (because they do), consider all closed doors a personal
  insult, maintain an aura of mystery while ensuring they are still the baby of
  the household
biologyNotes: Expert hunters whether they need to be or not, capable of sleeping
  18 hours a day yet somehow still exhausted, powered by spite and snacks,
  purring possibly functions as a self-healing mechanism (or a mind-control
  device for humans), flexible spines for improbable sleeping positions,
  whiskers as advanced sensory equipment, nine lives and the reckless confidence
  to test them all

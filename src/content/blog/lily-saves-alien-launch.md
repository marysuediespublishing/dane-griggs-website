I'm absolutely thrilled to announce the launch of a brand new series! **Lily Saves An Alien** is now live, introducing you to the magical world of Koko's Harbor for Wayward Fated Mates. If you've been missing my alien romances since Saving Ceraste, this new adventure is exactly what you've been waiting for!

## A Fresh Start in Every Way

Meet Lilith "Lily" Blackwell, a nurse who desperately needs a fresh start. After finally dumping her loser ex-boyfriend, she's driving cross-country to move back in with her beloved Aunt Zizi—just until she gets her feet back under her. But sometimes the universe has other plans.

When Lily's path takes an unexpected detour through the enchanting town of Lublin Harbor during its springtime "love" festival, she thinks she's just taking a scenic route. She couldn't be more wrong.

## Welcome to Lublin Harbor

This isn't just any small town—Lublin Harbor is a place where magic happens, where people find exactly what they need when they need it most, and where the mayor happens to be an enigmatic being named Koko who runs both the town and a bakery shop.

When a bizarre twist of fate strands Lily in the midst of the festival, she finds sanctuary in a secluded cabin. What she doesn't expect is for an alien spaceship to crash-land almost on her doorstep.

## Mango the Cat Steals the Show

I have to mention Mango—Lily's cat who has been getting rave reviews from readers! Sometimes the best characters have four legs and attitude, and Mango delivers both in spades. Readers are absolutely loving this spoiled feline who manages to steal scenes even in a romance between a human and an alien.

There's something special about including pets in romance novels. They add humor, heart, and that touch of everyday reality that grounds even the most fantastical stories.

## Ravok's Second Chance at Humanity

The alien Lily rescues is Ravok, and he's had a terrible introduction to humanity before crash-landing near her cabin. Injured and wary, he expects the worst from this human who finds him. Instead, he discovers Lily's gentle care, her nursing skills, and her ability to see past his alien appearance to the person underneath.

As she nurses him back to health, a bond develops that transcends language barriers and species differences. It's a connection deeper than anything Lily has ever experienced—and it's exactly what both of them need.

## A Different Kind of Alien Romance

While this book shares DNA with my Saving Ceraste series (competent heroines, no Mary Sues, relationships that develop naturally), Koko's Harbor has its own unique flavor. There's more of a paranormal small-town romance feel mixed with the sci-fi elements.

The setting allows for a more intimate, cozy romance while still delivering the alien culture clash and mysterious world-building elements my readers love.

## No Cookie Cutter Plot Devices

As always, I've avoided the tired tropes that make me roll my eyes in other books. Lily doesn't dither about her feelings or make "too stupid to live" decisions. She's a strong, caring woman who approaches problems with intelligence and compassion.

The plot includes genuine surprises and mysteries that unfold naturally rather than relying on misunderstandings or artificial drama to drive the story forward.

## Reader Reactions

The response to this new series launch has been fantastic! Early readers are saying:

*"It was so well plotted that it kept me guessing, which is a rare thing. No cookie cutter plot devices or worn tropes here. Lily was portrayed as someone I'd love to know."*

*"I can't wait to read the next book in this series. The story line was very believable. A lot of the stories I read have a rushed and unrealistic story. But this one was perfect."*

*"The story unfolds with drama, humor, danger, and mysterious goings on."*

## The Magic of Small Towns

There's something inherently romantic about small-town settings, especially when that town has a few magical secrets of its own. Lublin Harbor feels like the kind of place where anything could happen—and usually does.

The springtime love festival setting adds an extra layer of magic and possibility. When you're in a place dedicated to celebrating love, maybe it's easier for the impossible to become reality.

## Setting Up a New Universe

While Lily Saves An Alien works perfectly as a standalone, it's also establishing the foundation for future stories in Lublin Harbor. There are hints about other residents, other secrets, and other potential romances waiting to unfold.

Koko herself is clearly more than just a mayor and baker, and I'm excited to explore the mysteries surrounding both her and the town she protects.

## Where to Find It

*Lily Saves An Alien* is available now on Amazon and through Kindle Unlimited. Whether you're a longtime fan of my alien romances or someone discovering my work for the first time, this book offers everything I love about the genre: heart, humor, heat, and a happily ever after that feels completely earned.

This new series proves that sometimes the best adventures begin when you take an unexpected detour. Lily certainly never planned to rescue an alien, but isn't it wonderful when life surprises you with exactly what you didn't know you needed?

*Have you ever taken a detour that changed your life? And what do you think of small-town paranormal romance mixed with alien sci-fi? I'd love to hear your thoughts on this new adventure!*

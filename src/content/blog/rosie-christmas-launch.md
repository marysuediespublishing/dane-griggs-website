Surprise! I couldn't resist returning to the Saving Ceraste universe for a special holiday treat. **A Rosie Christmas** is now live, bringing you all the warmth, magic, and romance of the holiday season—with an alien twist that's sure to make your Christmas extra special this year!

## Christmas Magic Meets Alien Technology

There's something magical about Christmas that transcends species, and I wanted to explore how the Cerasteans might celebrate this very human holiday. What happens when beings who can cure cancer and travel between stars encounter the wonder of Christmas morning? The results are both heartwarming and hilarious.

Rosie's story brings together everything I love about holiday romance: family traditions, the magic of giving, second chances, and the kind of love that makes even the darkest winter days feel bright.

## A New Character, Familiar World

While this is Rosie's first appearance as a main character, longtime series readers will recognize the world and may spot some familiar faces. I wanted to create a story that welcomes new readers while giving series fans the comfort of returning to characters and places they love.

Rosie brings her own unique perspective to the human-Cerastean dynamic, and her Christmas story explores different aspects of what it means to build a life with someone from literally another world.

## Holiday Traditions, Alien Style

One of the most fun aspects of writing this book was imagining how Cerasteans might interpret human holiday traditions. What does Christmas look like when your partner has never seen snow, doesn't understand the concept of Santa Claus, but is absolutely determined to make your celebration perfect?

The cultural exchange moments are some of my favorite in the entire book. There's something deeply touching about someone learning your traditions because they want to understand what makes you happy.

## Why a Christmas Story?

After nine books of galactic conflict and high-stakes drama, I wanted to write something that focused on the quieter, more intimate moments that make relationships special. Christmas provides the perfect backdrop for those small, meaningful gestures that show how much someone cares.

Plus, there's something inherently hopeful about Christmas stories. They remind us that love, generosity, and human connection can triumph over any obstacle—even interspecies communication barriers!

## Romance in a Winter Wonderland

Rosie's romance unfolds against the backdrop of holiday preparations, gift exchanges, and all the cozy moments that make Christmas special. But this isn't just surface-level holiday cheer—it's about finding someone who wants to be part of your traditions and create new ones together.

The winter setting also provides opportunities for some genuinely romantic moments. Nothing says "I love you" quite like an alien learning to build snowmen or figuring out how to hang Christmas lights.

## Standalone Holiday Magic

While A Rosie Christmas is set in the Saving Ceraste universe, it's designed to work perfectly as a standalone holiday read. New readers can jump right in and enjoy the romance without needing extensive series background, while longtime fans get the bonus of returning to a beloved world.

It's the kind of book you can curl up with during the holidays, whether you're looking for a quick festive read or want to revisit the warmth of the Cerastean-human relationships.

## The Gift of Second Chances

Christmas stories are often about second chances, new beginnings, and the magic of believing in something wonderful. Rosie's story embodies all of those themes while adding the unique element of finding love across species lines.

There's something especially magical about holiday romance—the idea that the season of giving can bring you exactly what you didn't know you were looking for.

## Reader Response

Early readers have been sharing the most heartwarming reactions! The holiday theme combined with the familiar Saving Ceraste warmth has created exactly the kind of comfort reading people want during the winter season.

Comments include excitement about returning to this universe, appreciation for the holiday setting, and love for how the Christmas elements blend naturally with the sci-fi romance framework.

## Perfect Holiday Reading

Whether you're a longtime Saving Ceraste fan or someone looking for a unique holiday romance, A Rosie Christmas offers something special. It has all the warmth of a traditional Christmas story with the fun twist of alien cultural exchange and the steam of a Dane Griggs romance.

It's the kind of book that pairs perfectly with hot chocolate, holiday cookies, and a cozy reading nook.

## Where to Find It

*A Rosie Christmas* is available now on Amazon and through Kindle Unlimited. It's the perfect stocking stuffer for romance readers, and an ideal way to add some sci-fi magic to your holiday reading list.

This special holiday story proves that love, Christmas magic, and the warmth of found family can bridge any gap—even the space between worlds.

*What's your favorite holiday tradition to share with someone new? And how do you think aliens would interpret Christmas magic? I'd love to hear your thoughts on this festive addition to the series!*

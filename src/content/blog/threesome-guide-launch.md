Get ready for the wildest ride yet in the Saving Ceraste series! **Threesome's Guide to the Galaxy** is now available, and Chelsea's story is unlike anything I've written before. Fair warning: this book explores some heavier (and spicier) themes, but it's ultimately about healing, hope, and finding love in the most unexpected forms.

## From Darkness to Stars

Chelsea didn't volunteer for the Bride Program—she was kidnapped, held captive, and escaped by strange gray aliens. Now she has to rescue a pair of snake-like (but sexy) aliens from the clutches of the gray jerks.

What she didn't expect was to connect with not one, but two Cerastean mates: D'Rett and L'Tarne. These aliens - who are a close as brothers - have their own complicated history and have been waiting for the right person to complete their family unit.

## A Different Kind of Romance

I'll be honest—writing this book challenged me as an author. How do you write a romance for a character who's been through serious trauma? How do you show healing without minimizing the real impact of what she's experienced?

The answer was patience. Lots and lots of patience from everyone involved. And a ton of humor. D'Rett and L'Tarne never push Chelsea. They give her space, let her set the pace, and prove through their actions that she's safe with them. It's not insta-love—it's a slow rebuilding of trust and the gradual discovery that love can come in forms you never expected.

## Why a Threesome Romance?

Some readers might be surprised by this direction, but it felt right for Chelsea's story. She needs extra support, extra care, and extra love to heal from what she's been through. L'Tarne and D'Rett are perfect for her and they have a nest bond, meaning that they need to share a mate. D'Rett and L'Tarne aren't just her romantic partners—they're her protectors, her friends, and her chosen family.

## The Humor in Healing

Despite dealing with serious themes, this book still has the humor that readers love about this series. Chelsea's wit, natural cheet and naughty nature and the brothers' attempts to understand human culture (and figure out how to share a mate) lead to some genuinely funny moments.

There's a scene involving alien attempts at Earth food that had me laughing out loud while writing it. And don't get me started on their love of human movies and pop culture references.

## Continuing the Larger Story

While Chelsea's personal journey is the heart of this book, we're also advancing the series' larger plot. The Ostium threat is becoming more real, and the relationships between humans and Cerasteans are deepening in ways that will affect everyone.

## Reader Response

Early readers have been incredibly supportive of this book's approach to difficult themes:

*"In space, no one can hear you moan"* might be the tagline, but readers are praising the sensitive handling of trauma and the realistic pace of Chelsea's healing.

One reviewer noted: *"The series is so well-developed. Each individual story works on its own, but together they create something much bigger and more meaningful."*

## A Personal Note

This book was emotionally challenging to write, but also incredibly rewarding. Chelsea's journey from victim to survivor to someone who chooses love again felt important to tell. If you or someone you know has experienced trauma, please know that healing is possible, and you deserve love and happiness.

I also want to acknowledge that this book deals with mature themes and situations. While it maintains the series' hopeful tone, readers should be aware that it addresses kidnapping, trauma recovery, and healing.

## What's Coming Next

The Bride Program universe is expanding! Next up is *The Bride Program Honeymoon*, where we'll follow our couples as they take their first vacation together—and discover that even alien paradise planets can hold surprises.

## Where to Find It

*Threesome's Guide to the Galaxy* is available now on Amazon and through Kindle Unlimited. As always, it can be read as a standalone, but it's even better as part of the series journey.

This book represents growth for me as a writer and for the series as a whole. I hope Chelsea's story resonates with you and shows that love really can conquer all—especially when it comes in the form of two devoted alien mates who just want to keep you safe and happy.

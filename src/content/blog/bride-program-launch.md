I'm absolutely thrilled to announce that **The Bride Program** is now live on Amazon! This marks the beginning of what I hope will be an incredible journey through the Saving Ceraste universe, and I couldn't be more excited to share Maya and Commander D'Avii's story with you.

## What Would You Do to Save Someone You Love?

That's the question at the heart of The Bride Program. Maya Arnold was living an ordinary life—working a boring job, helping care for her sick sister, and watching too much TV with her mom on their old couch. Then the aliens arrived.

The Cerasteans offer something no human can refuse: a cure for cancer. But there's a catch. They need human brides to save their dying race, and Maya faces an impossible choice. Would you marry an alien to save the life of a family member?

## Meet the Cerasteans

I'm proud to have created the Cerasteans. They're not your typical romance heroes—they're survivors of a planetary catastrophe, snake-like in appearance, and desperately trying to rebuild their civilization. No alpha-holes here. Commander D'Avii is a warrior who never expected to be chosen, especially not by someone as fascinating as Maya.

But here's what I love most about this story: it's not just about the romance (though there's plenty of that!). It's about found family, about making hard choices, and about discovering that sometimes the best things in life come from the most unexpected places.

## What Readers Are Saying

The early reviews have been absolutely wonderful! Readers are loving:
- The unique world-building and alien culture
- Maya's strength and relatability
- The found family dynamics among the bride volunteers
- The slow-burn romance that actually develops naturally
- The humor mixed with genuine emotion

One reader wrote: *"This is the first book I've read by Dane Griggs, and it won't be my last. Maya and D'Avii are both easy to like, and despite the short length, everything is in it."*

## The Beginning of Something Bigger

The Bride Program is just the start. I already have plans for the other bride volunteers you'll meet in this book—Laney, Sara, Trinh, and all the others have their own stories to tell. Each will face their own challenges, meet their own alien matches, and discover that sometimes the best adventures begin when you least expect them.

## Where to Find It

The Bride Program is available now on Amazon in both Kindle and paperback formats. It's also included in Kindle Unlimited, so KU subscribers can dive right in!

I hope you'll join Maya on her journey to the stars. It's going to be quite a ride.

Valentine's Day just got a whole lot more interesting! **The Alien's Gossip Queen** is officially live, and Janet's story is exactly the kind of fun, heartwarming romance we all need. Get ready for medical drama, security protocols, and the juiciest gossip this side of the galaxy!

## When Gossip Meets Security

Janet accepted a job at the Cerastean healing center with one goal: focus on saving patients from cancer. But there's one tiny problem—Janet absolutely LOVES gossip. And a medical facility filled with humans and aliens? That's a treasure trove of romance, scandal, and fabulous rumors just waiting to be discovered.

Enter D'Xurrl, head of security for the facility, whose job is to keep everyone safe and secure. What he wasn't prepared for was one vivacious human with a sweet scent, a love of gossip, and curves that make him forget all about protocols.

## The Sweetest Alien Hero Yet

D'Xurrl might be my favorite Cerastean hero so far. He's sweet, protective, loves dogs (yes, dogs!), and has a body to die for. But what really sets him apart is how he handles Janet's personality. Instead of trying to change her or shut down her gossip sessions, he's genuinely charmed by her enthusiasm for other people's business.

He's learned the word "shenanigan" since coming to Earth, and he's discovered that humans—especially one particular human—encapsulate the term perfectly.

## Gossip as a Love Language

What I love about this book is how Janet's love of gossip isn't treated as a flaw that needs fixing. It's part of who she is, and it actually brings joy to the people around her. She keeps track of everyone's relationships, celebrates their victories, and provides emotional support disguised as "tea spilling."

D'Xurrl comes to understand that Janet's gossip isn't malicious—it's how she shows she cares about people. And when someone threatens the community she's grown to love, that protective gossip network becomes a real asset.

## Medical Drama Meets Romance

The healing center setting allows me to explore more of the practical side of human-Cerastean cooperation. Janet isn't just there for the romance—she's a medical professional doing important work alongside alien colleagues who are literally saving lives.

The workplace dynamic adds another layer to her relationship with D'Xurrl. He's responsible for everyone's safety, including hers, which creates natural opportunities for protective moments and workplace tension.

## Could She Love Gossip Less Than an Alien?

The central question of the book becomes: Could Janet actually love something—or someone—more than spilling tea? It's a question that surprises her as much as anyone else. She's always been the one focused on other people's love lives. Now she's discovering that having her own might be even better than talking about everyone else's.

## A Quick Side Story with Big Impact

I originally planned this as a shorter, lighter story—a quick step away from the main series arc. But Janet and D'Xurrl had other ideas! Their story ended up needing more room to develop, which I think makes it even better.

Even though it's a "side story," it has major implications for the series. The healing center is a crucial part of human-Cerastean cooperation, and the relationships formed there affect everyone in the program.

## Reader Reactions

The response to Janet's story has been fantastic! Readers are loving:

- Janet's infectious personality and genuine care for others
- D'Xurrl's sweetness and patience with human "shenanigans"
- The medical setting and workplace romance elements
- The humor in Janet's gossip sessions
- How the relationship develops naturally from friendship

Early reviews mention: *"There is nothing I love more than juicy gossip... But there might actually be something, or someone, I could love more."*

## The Perfect Valentine's Release

Releasing this book on Valentine's Day feels perfect—it's all about discovering unexpected love and finding someone who appreciates you exactly as you are. Janet doesn't have to give up her love of gossip to find romance; she finds someone who thinks her curiosity about other people is endearing rather than annoying.

## Building Toward Something Bigger

While Janet and D'Xurrl are falling in love, the larger series plot continues to develop. The work at the healing center, the relationships between humans and Cerasteans, and the ongoing Ostium situation all play important roles in this story.

Janet's position at the center also gives her access to information that will be crucial in upcoming books. Sometimes the best intelligence comes from people who pay attention to everything and everyone.

## Where to Find It

*The Alien's Gossip Queen* is available now on Amazon and through Kindle Unlimited. It's the perfect feel-good romance for readers who want humor, heart, and a heroine who's unapologetically interested in everyone's business.

This book proves that there's someone for everyone—even gossip queens can find aliens who appreciate their unique talents!

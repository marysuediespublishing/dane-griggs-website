**Heelllooo Captain Back Muscles!** The cover for book 7 is finally done, and I absolutely LOVE it! **Marshmallow** is now live on Amazon, and I'm so happy with how this story turned out. It may actually be my favorite so far. I mean, who doesn't love a gruff, tough hero with a soft gooey marshmallow center?

## The General's Long-Awaited Story

If you've been following the Saving Ceraste series, you know General D'Annon has been hovering in the background, protecting everyone and being his usual overprotective, rule-following self. Sara has been watching him just as closely, even though she never planned to become a bride to any of the Cerastean aliens.

But when Sara's mom has a heart attack and she needs to return to Earth, what should have been a simple trip home turns into the adventure of a lifetime. And finally—FINALLY—our gruff General gets to show his true colors.

## Why "Marshmallow"?

The title came to me because that's exactly what D'Annon is—tough and intimidating on the outside, but with the softest, sweetest center. He's been in love with Sara for months, but he's also been her protector, keeping his distance and making sure she feels safe on the ship.

Like most Cerasteans, D'Annon can smell emotions, and Sara's sadness and fear in her early days broke his heart. Now that those feelings are back as she prepares to leave, he can't help but step in to escort her home personally.

## A Darker Story with Important Themes

This book explores some heavier territory than my previous ones. I tackle the serious topic of domestic violence and its long-term effects. Sara's need to return home isn't just about helping her mom—she's also dealing with a situation that requires all of D'Annon's protective instincts.

I spent a lot of time researching and thinking about how to handle this topic respectfully. Everyone deserves love and safety, and I wanted to show Sara's journey from fear to healing to finding the love she truly deserves.

## The Romance We've Been Waiting For

What I love most about this story is that D'Annon has always loved Sara. He's been watching over her, caring about her wellbeing, and respecting her space. When circumstances finally allow him to speak freely and show his heart, the emotional payoff is incredible.

Sara, meanwhile, discovers that the security and safety she's felt on the ship has a lot to do with one particular alien who's been quietly making sure she's okay. Sometimes the best romances are the ones that sneak up on you.

## Smart Heroine Alert

True to my "no Mary Sue" promise, Sara doesn't sit around debating what to do when trouble strikes. Our smart girl calls the General for help immediately. I'm so tired of heroines who waste time with internal debates when the obvious solution is right there. Sara knows a good resource when she sees one!

## Reader Reactions

The early response has been absolutely wonderful:

*"This is the best one yet. Finally the General and his Sara... I love that this author writes strong intelligent women."*

*"The character development between the 2 main characters and the history of abuse was really brought in nicely. It was very well done."*

*"That 'back' on the cover....hot, hot, hot!!!! Sara is finally so happy and safe. And the romance is so sweet and sexy."*

## A Personal Challenge

I won't lie—this book was emotionally challenging to write. Dealing with domestic violence themes while maintaining the hopeful, romantic tone of the series required a careful balance. But I felt Sara's story needed to be told, and D'Annon was the perfect hero to help her heal.

I really hope I gave these characters the love story they deserve. They've been taking up space in my thoughts for almost a year, and I actually care deeply about these figments of my imagination!

## The Series Continues

While Marshmallow focuses on Sara and D'Annon's relationship, it also advances the larger series plot. The Ostium threat is growing, and the bonds between humans and Cerasteans are becoming more crucial than ever.

You'll also get to see all your favorite characters from previous books as they support Sara and deal with their own continuing adventures.

## Where to Find It

*Marshmallow* is available now on Amazon and through Kindle Unlimited. As with all the books in this series, it can be read as a standalone, but it's even more satisfying as part of the complete journey.

This story tackles hard topics but ultimately celebrates the power of love, healing, and finding someone who makes you feel truly safe. D'Annon and Sara have both been through difficult times, but together they find the happiness they both deserve.

*Have you been waiting for the General's story? What do you think of tough heroes with soft centers? I'd love to hear your thoughts on this emotional installment!*

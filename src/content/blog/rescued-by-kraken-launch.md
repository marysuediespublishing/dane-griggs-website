The magic of Koko's Harbor continues! **Rescued By A Kraken** is now live, and I'm so excited to share Rose's story with you. If you thought Lily's alien rescue was unexpected, wait until you meet the kraken who's about to turn one woman's peaceful vacation into the deepest love she's ever known.

## When Fear Meets Fate

Rose has come to Lublin Harbor with plans to leave again soon—this is just a temporary stop, a quick vacation before she returns to her desert home. Rose was enjoying her time on the water when a freak storm struck, but her rescue comes from the most unexpected source - a kraken who will change everything she thought she knew about the depths of the ocean and her own heart.

## A Kraken in Paranormal Romance

I'll be honest—when I decided to write a kraken romance, I wondered if I was pushing the boundaries too far. But the more I developed Levi's character and his connection to the sea, the more I realized this was exactly the story I wanted to tell.

Krakens aren't exactly common in paranormal romance, and I loved the challenge of making this relationship feel both fantastical and completely believable. Levi's dual nature—human on land, powerful sea creature in his element—creates unique opportunities for both conflict and connection.

## The Magic of Lublin Harbor Deepens

This second book allows us to explore more of what makes Lublin Harbor special. The town isn't just a backdrop—it's almost a character itself, drawing people who need healing and providing exactly the right circumstances for love to flourish.

Koko's role becomes even more intriguing, and we get hints about the magical undercurrents that make this place a haven for wayward fated mates. There's clearly much more to discover about this town and its mysterious mayor.

## Reader Response

The early reactions have been incredible! Readers are particularly loving:

*"...This book was a fantastic continuation of the series, and I was intrigued with the premise of a Kraken in a paranormal romance. I've never seen one before."*

*"After reading the first book in this series I couldn't wait to get back to Lublin Harbor and I was pleasantly surprised that I liked this book even more than the first book."*

*"The romance between Levi and Rose was so sweet and I feel like I'm getting so invested in all the other characters in Lublin Harbor."*

## Expanding the Universe

While Rose and Levi's romance is the heart of this book, I'm also building the foundation for future stories. The residents of Lublin Harbor each seem to have their own secrets and stories waiting to be told.

The magical realism elements allow for endless possibilities—what other supernatural beings might find their way to this haven? What other fears might be transformed into love?

## The Departure Decision

The central tension of the book revolves around Rose's planned departure from Lublin Harbor. As her leaving date approaches, she has to decide: can she bear to leave behind Levi and the mysterious kraken who's captured not just her imagination, but her heart?

This internal conflict drives the emotional core of the story and leads to some truly beautiful moments of character growth and romantic revelation.

## Where to Find It

*Rescued By A Kraken* is available now on Amazon and through Kindle Unlimited. While it builds beautifully on the world established in *Lily Saves An Alien*, it also works as a standalone for readers who love paranormal romance with a twist.

This book proves that love really can come from the depths—literally and figuratively. Sometimes the thing we fear most is exactly what we need to become whole.

## Looking Forward

The Koko's Harbor series is just getting started! With two books establishing this magical world, I'm excited to explore more stories of wayward souls finding their fated mates in the most unexpected ways.

Who knows what other supernatural beings might wash up on Lublin Harbor's shores, or what other fears might be transformed into love?

*What's your biggest fear that you'd want love to help you overcome? And have you ever encountered a kraken in romance before? I'd love to hear your thoughts on this unique addition to the paranormal romance world!*

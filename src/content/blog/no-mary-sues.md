When I started writing the **Saving Ceraste** series, I made a conscious decision that would shape every book I've written since: **no Mary Sues allowed**. This wasn't just a marketing slogan—it was a fundamental commitment to creating heroines who feel real, capable, and genuinely interesting.

## What Makes a Mary Sue?

For those unfamiliar with the term, a "Mary Sue" is a character (usually female) who is perfect in every way: impossibly beautiful, loved by everyone, and capable of solving any problem without realistic skills or experience. They're often blank slates for readers to project onto, but they lack the depth and flaws that make characters truly compelling.

In romance, Mary Sues often manifest as:
- Heroines who are described as plain but somehow irresistible to every male character
- Characters who master complex skills instantly without training
- Women who solve problems through luck or intuition rather than competence
- Personalities that are entirely reactive rather than proactive

## The Problem with Perfect

Here's the thing about Mary Sues: they're boring. When a character can do everything perfectly, there's no tension, no growth, and no real stakes. Readers might fantasize about being perfect, but they connect with characters who struggle, fail, learn, and succeed through effort.

More importantly, Mary Sues send a subtle but damaging message: that women are only valuable when they're impossibly perfect or when they need rescuing. That's not the kind of romance I want to write or read.

## My Alternative: Competent Heroines

Instead of Mary Sues, I write what I call "competent heroines"—women who:

### Have Real Skills
Every heroine in my books is a professional with genuine expertise. Maya is a skilled doctor, Zara understands trauma medicine, Ally is a brilliant engineer. Their knowledge isn't superficial; it's the result of years of training and experience.

### Make Mistakes
Competent doesn't mean perfect. My heroines miscommunicate, misjudge situations, and sometimes let their emotions override their logic. These flaws make them human and give them room to grow.

### Solve Problems Actively
When challenges arise, my heroines don't wait to be rescued. They use their skills, their intelligence, and their determination to find solutions. Sometimes they need help (because realistic people ask for help), but they're active participants in their own stories.

### Have Their Own Goals
Beyond finding love, my heroines have professional ambitions, personal dreams, and individual motivations. Romance enhances their lives rather than defining them entirely.

## The Reader Response

The feedback on this approach has been overwhelmingly positive. Readers consistently tell me they appreciate heroines who feel "real" and "relatable." They love seeing women who are good at their jobs, who think through problems logically, and who contribute equally to their relationships.

One reader wrote: *"Finally, a romance where I don't have to suspend disbelief about why the hero would fall for someone who can't tie her own shoes."*

Another said: *"Your heroines inspire me to be better at my own job. They make competence look sexy."*

## Tips for Writing Competent Heroines

If you're a writer looking to avoid Mary Sue territory, here are some strategies that work for me:

1. **Give them a real profession** and research it thoroughly
2. **Let them fail sometimes** and show how they recover
3. **Make their skills relevant** to the plot
4. **Show their expertise** through action, not just dialogue
5. **Give them opinions** that sometimes conflict with other characters
6. **Let them teach others** and learn from others

## The Romance Balance

Some writers worry that competent heroines won't need the hero, undermining the romance. In my experience, the opposite is true. When both characters bring something valuable to the relationship, their connection feels more balanced and sustainable.

My Cerastean heroes aren't attracted to my heroines despite their competence—they're attracted because of it. Intelligence is sexy. Skill is attractive. Confidence is appealing.

## Final Thoughts

Writing compelling heroines isn't about making them perfect; it's about making them real. Readers don't need characters they can only aspire to be—they need characters they can see themselves in, characters who face challenges with courage and skill.

The "no Mary Sue" promise isn't just about what I won't write; it's about what I will: stories with heroines who are smart, capable, and thoroughly human. Because at the end of the day, that's the kind of woman worth falling in love with—both for alien heroes and for readers.

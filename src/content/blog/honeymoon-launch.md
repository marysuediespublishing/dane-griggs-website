Pack your bags for an intergalactic vacation! **The Bride Program Honeymoon** is now available, and it's time for our favorite couples to finally get some well-deserved relaxation. But this is a Dane Griggs book, so you know that "relaxation" is going to come with a side of adventure, mystery, and shocking revelations.

## Paradise Found... With Complications

Laney is getting married to her dream alien, and she couldn't be happier! After everything she and L'Arc have been through, a romantic honeymoon on a lush tropical paradise in another galaxy sounds perfect. Several of her bride volunteer friends are joining them for the trip to Xerini—the dulci home world—and Laney is ready for beaches, relaxation, and plenty of alone time with her new husband.

What could possibly go wrong? (You know me well enough by now to know that's a rhetorical question!)

## The Gang's All Here

One of the things I love most about this book is getting to see all our favorite couples together. Laney and L'Arc, Maya and D'Avii, Serena and L'Vect, Chelsea with D'Rett and L'Tarne—they're all taking this vacation together, and the group dynamics are absolutely delightful.

There's something special about seeing these relationships that we've watched develop individually now interacting as a found family. The banter, the support, the shared adventures—it really showcases how these women have become sisters and their alien mates have become brothers.

## More Than Just Romance

While the couples are enjoying their honeymoon activities (and trust me, there's plenty of steam!), they're also learning more about the galaxy they now call home. The dulci home world isn't just a pretty vacation spot—it's a chance to see how other species interact with the Cerasteans.

And then there's the small matter of running into an Ostium princess. Remember the Ostiums? The ones who've been threatening everyone? Well, it turns out not all of them are on board with the whole "destroy the Cerasteans" plan. This discovery changes everything.

## Presenting Ceremony Drama

The book opens with a Presenting Ceremony—the formal event where new bride volunteers choose their Cerastean mates. It's always been a highlight of the series, but this one comes with extra significance as our established couples watch new love stories begin.

These ceremonies also serve as a great way to check in with the broader community on the ship and see how the Bride Program is evolving. Plus, there's always drama when you put that many personalities in one room!

## World-Building and Wonder

Xerini itself is a character in this book. I had so much fun creating this alien paradise—think tropical beaches with a sci-fi twist. The dulci (those adorable little blue chameleon creatures from previous books) get to show off their home world, and it's every bit as charming as you'd expect.

But I also used this setting to explore larger questions about interspecies cooperation and the complex politics of the galaxy. Not everyone is happy about human-Cerastean partnerships, and some of those tensions come to a head during this supposedly peaceful vacation.

## Reader Feedback

Early readers have had enthusiastic reactions to this installment:

Readers loved getting to see all the couples together and appreciated the deeper world-building.

One reader noted: *"Although this book has a lot of romance, the story is interesting, and the new character is fascinating."*

Another mentioned: *"I personally always like seeing the same scene from multiple perspectives. I love to see how two people can interpret the same scene differently."*

## Setting Up the Future

While this book focuses on celebration and relaxation, it also sets up crucial plot points for the rest of the series. The information our couples discover about the Ostiums will have major implications for everyone's future.

Plus, watching these established relationships navigate new situations gives us insight into how strong their bonds have become—information that will be crucial as bigger challenges arise.

## A Breather Before the Storm

Think of this book as the calm before the storm. Our couples get to enjoy their happiness, strengthen their relationships, and prepare for whatever comes next. But knowing me, even the calm comes with its share of surprises!

## Where to Find It

*The Bride Program Honeymoon* is available now on Amazon and through Kindle Unlimited. It's the perfect book for readers who want to spend more time with beloved characters while discovering new aspects of the Saving Ceraste universe.

Whether you're here for the romance, the world-building, or the shocking twists (yes, there are definitely shocking twists), this honeymoon has something for everyone.

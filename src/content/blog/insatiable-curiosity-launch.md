**Insatiable Curiosity** is now live, and I'm absolutely thrilled to share Ally's story with you! This book is for every engineer, every space enthusiast, and everyone who's ever wanted to take something apart just to see how it works. If you've been waiting for a heroine who geeks out over alien technology, this is your book!

## The Astronaut Who Never Made It to Space

Ally has wanted to be an astronaut for as long as she can remember, but an eye condition dashed those dreams before they could take flight. So when she finds herself on a Cerastean ship surrounded by the most advanced technology in the galaxy, she can't help herself—she HAS to know how everything works.

After being caught sneaking into engineering one too many times (because of course she was), Ally gets assigned to work with Cerastean Scientist L'Zaen to re-engineer an Ostium weapon. It's literally a dream job, even if it comes with some serious responsibilities.

## A Meeting of Brilliant Minds

L'Zaen is everything an alien scientist should be—brilliant, dedicated, and completely fascinated by problems that would make other people's heads spin. When he meets Ally, he discovers something wonderful: a human whose insatiable curiosity makes every day an adventure.

I loved writing their professional relationship before it becomes romantic. They're genuine colleagues first, respecting each other's expertise and building something together. It's the kind of partnership that makes you believe in workplace romance done right.

## Space Travel and Alien Festivals

When their work earns them an invitation to a festival on the Hisk homeworld, Ally's greatest dream finally comes true—she gets to explore space and experience alien cultures firsthand. The festival itself is a celebration of technology and cooperation between species, which is absolutely perfect for our tech-loving heroine.

The journey also allows for some wonderful world-building as we see more of the galaxy beyond the Cerastean ship and learn about their allies and trading partners.

## Engineering Romance

What sets this book apart is how central Ally's professional expertise is to the plot. She's not just along for the ride—her engineering skills are crucial to their mission. Watching her and L'Zaen work together, combining human and Cerastean approaches to solve complex problems, is genuinely exciting.

There's something incredibly romantic about two brilliant people challenging each other intellectually while falling in love. Their debates about technology are just as heated as their romantic moments!

## The Guitar Scene

Without spoiling anything, I will say that there's a scene involving a guitar that broke my heart while writing it. Sometimes the smallest gestures reveal the biggest hearts, and L'Zaen's understanding of what music means to humans—and to Ally specifically—shows just how much he truly sees her.

Readers have been messaging me about this scene specifically, and I'm so glad it hit the emotional note I was hoping for.

## Concurrent Timeline Fun

For series readers, this book takes place partly during the events of *The Bride Program Honeymoon*, which means you get to see some familiar scenes from a completely different perspective. I love writing these concurrent timelines—it's fascinating how the same event can mean different things to different characters.

## Reader Response

The feedback has been wonderful! Readers are particularly loving:

*"I love that the beginning of this book is occurring concurrently with the Bride Program Honeymoon book. I personally always like seeing the same scene from multiple perspectives."*

*"AND OMG THE GUITAR GIFT PART BROKE MY HEART. These Cerastean men deserve all the love in the world!!"*

*"At this point, I am personally hooked on this series."*

## A Heroine After My Own Heart

Ally represents something I really wanted to explore—what happens when someone's dreams get derailed, but then life offers them something even better? She never got to be an astronaut, but she ends up doing something far more exciting: helping to engineer weapons that could save entire civilizations.

Her curiosity isn't just a personality trait—it's her superpower. In a world where women are often told to be less curious, less questioning, less eager to understand how things work, Ally is unapologetically herself.

## The Bigger Picture

While Ally and L'Zaen are falling in love and geeking out over technology, they're also working on something that could be crucial in the coming conflict with the Ostium. Their research has implications far beyond their personal relationship.

This adds weight to their romance—they're not just finding love, they're building something together that could help save the people they care about.

## Where to Find It

*Insatiable Curiosity* is available now on Amazon and through Kindle Unlimited. Whether you're an engineer yourself, a space enthusiast, or just someone who loves seeing brilliant people fall in love while saving the galaxy, this book has something for you.

Ally and L'Zaen's story proves that the best relationships are built on mutual respect, shared passions, and the willingness to explore new frontiers together—whether those frontiers are technological, emotional, or somewhere out among the stars.

*Are you team "take it apart to see how it works" or team "if it's not broken, don't touch it"? And what do you think Ally and L'Zaen will discover about Ostium technology? I'd love to hear your thoughts!*

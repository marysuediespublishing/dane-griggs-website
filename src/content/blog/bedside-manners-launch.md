The second book in the Saving Ceraste series is officially live! **Bedside Manners for Aliens** takes us deeper into the world of human-Cerastean cooperation, this time through the eyes of a brilliant hematologist and a socially awkward alien physician.

## When Medicine Meets Heart

Dr. Serena jumped at the chance to work with Cerastean doctors—after all, they can cure cancer. What she didn't expect was to be paired with Physician L'Vect, a brilliant but completely clueless alien who's scaring the patients with his awkward bedside manner.

L'Vect has always been socially inept, even among his own people. Now, trying to treat human patients, he's even more out of his depth. Enter Serena, who sees past his gruff exterior to the caring physician underneath—and volunteers to teach him how to connect with humans.

## An Introvert's Love Story

What I love most about this book is that it's truly an introvert's romance. L'Vect isn't the typical alpha male hero—he's uncertain, struggles with social cues, and genuinely doesn't understand how to prevent humans from finding him intimidating. He's the alien equivalent of that brilliant doctor who knows everything about medicine but nothing about people.

Serena, meanwhile, is dealing with her own challenges. She's passionate about her work, frustrated by the protests against the alien medical program, and increasingly drawn to this awkward alien who's trying so hard to help their patients.

## Medical Drama

The medical setting also allowed me to explore some of the ethical questions surrounding the Bride Program. Not everyone on Earth is happy about alien intervention, and the protests outside the medical facility add real tension to Serena and L'Vect's developing relationship.

## Building the Series

One of the things readers have mentioned loving about this series is how interconnected everything feels. You'll see Maya and D'Avii from the first book, get hints about what's coming for other characters, and learn more about Cerastean society and the larger threats they're facing.

L'Vect's character also allowed me to explore what it means to be different within your own culture. He's an outsider among his own people, which makes his connection with Serena—who's also somewhat isolated by her dedication to her work—even more meaningful.

## Reader Reactions

The response has been fantastic so far! Readers are particularly loving:
- L'Vect's genuine character growth
- The medical setting
- Serena's competence and patience
- The humor in L'Vect's attempts to understand human behavior
- The slow development of trust and attraction

One reviewer wrote: *"I really loved this odd romance. The guy isn't the regular hot blooded hero which is refreshing. She's not a wilting damsel in distress."*

Another said: *"Dane Griggs hit a home run with this novel! The characters have charm and surprising depth... What could top beer pong with aliens? How about the cure for cancer!?!"*

## What's Next

If you've been following Maya's story in the first book, you'll love seeing how Serena fits into the growing community of human women on the Cerastean ship. And if you're new to the series, this book works perfectly as a standalone while giving you a taste of the larger world.

Next up: Chelsea's story in *Threesome's Guide to the Galaxy*—and trust me, that title tells you everything you need to know about where we're headed next!

## Where to Get It

*Bedside Manners for Aliens* is available now on Amazon in Kindle and paperback formats, and it's included in Kindle Unlimited.

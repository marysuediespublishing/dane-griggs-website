# Saving Ceraste

The complete ten-book series that established Dane Griggs as the author who writes competent heroines and aliens who respect human intelligence.

## Series Overview

When the Cerasteans arrive on Earth offering a cure for cancer in exchange for human brides, desperate women face an impossible choice. What follows is an epic story of cooperation, survival, and unexpected love that spans ten interconnected books.

What could possibly entice human women to willingly join a program meant to match them with snake-like alien husbands?

Maya joins for the chance to save the life of a loved one. Serena jumps at the chance to help cure cancer. Kidnap victim Chelsea just wants to escape her tormentors, but ends up finding love with not one but two aliens... And the list goes on. Some women want adventure, some want to serve the greater good and some want an escape but all find the love they never knew they needed.

## The Cerastean World

The Cerasteans are an advanced species who lost their homeworld to a mysterious catastrophe. They're snake-like in appearance but possess:
- **Advanced Medical Technology**: Can cure diseases that baffle human medicine
- **Emotional Scent Detection**: Can literally smell human emotions
- **Caste-Based Society**: Scientists, warriors, and other specializations with complex social rules
- **Mating Bonds**: Form deep, lasting connections with compatible partners
- **Collective Trauma**: The loss of their world and most of their women shapes every interaction

## The Ostium Threat

Throughout the series, the growing threat of the Ostium—the species responsible for destroying the Cerastean homeworld—creates urgency and unites both species in common cause.

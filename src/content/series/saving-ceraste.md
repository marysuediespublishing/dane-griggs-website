# Saving Ceraste Series

## Series Overview

The **Saving Ceraste** series is my flagship sci-fi romance collection, featuring nine interconnected standalone novels set in a richly detailed universe where human women and Cerastean males work together to save both their species.

When Earth faces a population crisis and the Cerastean homeworld suffers from genetic bottlenecking, an innovative solution emerges: the Bride Program. This carefully designed exchange brings together genetically compatible partners from both species, creating unions that could save two civilizations.

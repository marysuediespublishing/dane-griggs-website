*Welcome to Lublin Harbor, a magical coastal town where lost souls find exactly what they need—including love with supernatural beings who've been waiting for them.*

Nestled in the scenic coastline, the charming town of Lublin Harbor appears to be just another quaint small town. But appearances can be deceiving.

## What Makes This Series Special

### Small-Town Paranormal Romance
Unlike urban fantasy set in big cities, Koko's Harbor explores the magic that can exist in small, intimate communities where everyone knows everyone—and where secrets are both harder to keep and more precious when shared.

### Cozy Mystery Elements  
The magical realism of Lublin Harbor creates a cozy, welcoming atmosphere even when supernatural drama unfolds. The town itself acts as a character, providing sanctuary and guidance to those who need it most.

### Fated Mates with Agency
While the series explores fated mate connections, the characters always have choice and agency in their relationships. The magical bond enhances their connection but doesn't override their individual personalities or decision-making.

### Healing and Second Chances
Each book focuses on characters who are recovering from something—heartbreak, trauma, fear—and finding that love and magic can help heal even the deepest wounds.

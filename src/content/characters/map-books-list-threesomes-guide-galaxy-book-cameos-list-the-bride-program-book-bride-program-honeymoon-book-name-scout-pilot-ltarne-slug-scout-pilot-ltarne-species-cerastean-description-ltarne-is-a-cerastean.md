name: Scout Pilot L'Tarne
slug: scout-pilot-ltarne
description: L'Tarne is a Cerastean scout pilot from the Scientist caste who
  specializes in navigation and encryption, with streaked golden hair ranging
  from white to light brown and sharp, predatory features that belie his quick
  grin and animated eyes. Tall and rangy with a narrow waist and pronounced
  cheekbones, he has the typical Cerastean attributes of golden slit-pupil eyes,
  diamond-patterned scales, small horns, and a forked tongue that enhances his
  sense of smell. As the more outgoing and talkative half of his nest-bonded
  partnership with D'Rett, L'Tarne often takes the lead in social situations due
  to his higher caste status, though he considers himself equal to his warrior
  partner. A secret romantic comedy fanatic who enthusiastically embraces human
  culture, he's quick-witted with an expanded vocabulary of colorful human curse
  words and delights in playful banter. Despite his sometimes cocky exterior,
  L'Tarne is deeply caring and protective, with a dreamer's heart that yearns
  for the mate bond he thought might never come due to his unusual partnership
  arrangement.

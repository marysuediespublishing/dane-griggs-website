name: Mango
slug: mango
description: Mango is Lily’s steadfast feline companion, a striking orange tabby
  with citrine eyes that gleam with curiosity and mischief. Content to ride
  cross-country in his crate, he’s adaptable yet opinionated, quick to voice his
  feelings with a well-timed “mrow.” Though initially resistant to leash
  training, he’s growing more adventurous, happily exploring alongside Lily when
  given the chance. Affectionate and food-motivated, Mango purrs like an engine
  when indulged - whether that’s sharing a bit of piroshki or soaking up
  attention from strangers - making him both Lily’s comfort and her
  co-conspirator on the road to a new life.

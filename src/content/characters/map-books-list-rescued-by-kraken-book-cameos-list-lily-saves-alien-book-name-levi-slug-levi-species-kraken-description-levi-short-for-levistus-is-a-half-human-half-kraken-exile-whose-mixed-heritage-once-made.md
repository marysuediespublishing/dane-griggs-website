name: Levi
slug: levi
description: Levi, short for Levistus, is a half-human, half-kraken exile whose
  mixed heritage once made him an outsider in his underwater kingdom. Physically
  powerful and skilled, he’s equally at home in the crushing depths of the
  Midnight Zone or navigating in human form on the surface. Stoic and reserved
  by nature, Levi carries the scars of betrayal and prejudice, preferring
  solitude to small talk, yet he possesses a deep sense of loyalty and
  protectiveness toward those he chooses to trust. Since finding sanctuary in
  Lublin Harbor under the goddess Mokosh’s protection, he’s worked quietly as a
  guide, revealing the area’s beauty to visitors while keeping its magical
  secrets safe. Beneath his guarded exterior lies a thoughtful, observant soul
  who notices more than he lets on - and whose connection to the sea runs as
  deep as the tides themselves.

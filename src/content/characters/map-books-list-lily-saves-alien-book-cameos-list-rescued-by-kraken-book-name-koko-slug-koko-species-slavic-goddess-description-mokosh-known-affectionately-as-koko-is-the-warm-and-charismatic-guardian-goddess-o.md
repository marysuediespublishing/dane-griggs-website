description: Mokosh, known affectionately as Koko, is the warm and charismatic
  guardian goddess of Lublin Harbor, blending an air of approachable charm with
  an undercurrent of ancient power. In her human guise, she’s a tall, striking
  blonde with a ready smile, expressive eyes, and a playful, 1950s housewife
  aesthetic - often seen in colorful dresses and aprons embroidered with
  whimsical details like flowers and spiders. As the harbor’s protector, she
  uses her magic to shield its mystical residents from prying human eyes, subtly
  shaping the environment to suit her needs - like keeping the harbor waters
  comfortably warm. Koko thrives on fostering community, greeting newcomers with
  genuine hospitality, welcome baskets, and personal touches that make them feel
  at home, all while ensuring that they respect the town’s secrets and
  contribute to its well-being.

description: Laney Calhoun is a 28-year-old paralegal with vibrant red curly
  hair, freckles scattered across her pale skin, and warm brown eyes. Standing
  at 5'10", she's tall for a human woman with a confident, curvy figure that
  she's learned to embrace. After her ex-fianc√© Ben's betrayal just a month
  before their wedding, Laney's self-esteem took a hit, but joining the Bride
  Program has helped her rediscover her worth. She's naturally witty and uses
  humor when feeling vulnerable, has a tendency to be bossy (especially in bed),
  and possesses a resilient spirit that shines through during crises. Though she
  prefers "glamping" to roughing it and loves being spoiled by her mate L'Arc,
  she proves surprisingly resourceful and determined when faced with challenges.
  Her freckles, which she once considered a flaw, have become one of L'Arc's
  favorite features, and she's learned to see herself through his adoring eyes
  as the beautiful, strong woman she truly is.

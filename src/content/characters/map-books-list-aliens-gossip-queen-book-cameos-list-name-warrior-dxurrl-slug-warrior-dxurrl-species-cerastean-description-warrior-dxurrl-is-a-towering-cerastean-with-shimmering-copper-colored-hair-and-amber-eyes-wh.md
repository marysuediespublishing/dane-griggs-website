name: Warrior D'Xurrl
slug: warrior-dxurrl
description: Warrior D'Xurrl is a towering Cerastean with shimmering
  copper-colored hair and amber eyes who serves as head of security at the
  Deerfield Medical Facility. Despite his intimidating size and snake-like
  appearance that initially frightens humans, he's remarkably gentle,
  kind-hearted, and patient. D'Xurrl has a specialization in military strategy
  and tactics, but he's also deeply curious about human culture and customs,
  often misunderstanding colloquialisms in endearing ways. He has a particular
  love for rain (a new experience from his desert home planet) and an immediate
  fascination with dogs, especially Waffles the service dog. D'Xurrl is earnest
  and sincere in his desire to connect with humans, particularly Janet, whom he
  courts with old-fashioned devotion. His protective nature extends beyond his
  security duties to genuine care for the patients and staff, making him
  well-respected despite the initial fear his appearance might inspire.

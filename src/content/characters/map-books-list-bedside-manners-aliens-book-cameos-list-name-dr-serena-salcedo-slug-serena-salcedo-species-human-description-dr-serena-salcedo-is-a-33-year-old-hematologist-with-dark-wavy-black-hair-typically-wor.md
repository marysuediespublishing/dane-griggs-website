slug: serena-salcedo
description: Dr. Serena Salcedo is a 33-year-old hematologist with dark wavy
  black hair (typically worn in a bun) and brown eyes. She's slender and
  dedicated to her work, specializing in treating cancer patients like those
  with leukemia and lymphoma. Serena has a warm, compassionate bedside manner
  and natural curiosity about the world around her - traits that make her
  excellent at both patient care and adapting to working with the alien
  Cerasteans. She's intelligent and slightly nerdy, with a love for reading
  (including the occasional romance novel), and maintains a practical,
  no-nonsense approach to life. Despite being divorced and initially cautious
  about relationships, she's kind-hearted and forms deep connections with those
  around her. Her scientific mind and genuine empathy make her an ideal bridge
  between human patients and their alien healers, while her resilience and quick
  thinking prove invaluable in dangerous situations.

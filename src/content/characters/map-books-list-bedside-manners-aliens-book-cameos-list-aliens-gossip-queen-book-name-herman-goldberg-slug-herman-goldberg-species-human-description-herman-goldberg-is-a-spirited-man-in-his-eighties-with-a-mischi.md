name: Herman Goldberg
slug: herman-goldberg
description: Herman Goldberg is a spirited man in his eighties with a
  mischievous charm and an incorrigible flirtatious streak. A decorated war
  veteran and terminal cancer patient, he received life-saving treatment at the
  Deerfield Medical Facility, where he quickly became a favorite among staff and
  fellow patients alike. Herman’s wit and warmth make him a source of levity
  even in the most serious moments - whether he’s teasing Serena with marriage
  proposals, charming nurses, or offering playful banter to anyone who visits.
  His resilience, humor, and zest for connection embody the hope and joy that
  the Cerastean cures bring to their patients.

name: Chancellor L’Forn
slug: chancellor-lforn
description: Chancellor L’Forn is the steadfast leader of the remaining
  Cerastean refugees - just over four thousand survivors - stationed on B187. A
  dignified, disciplined figure with long white hair and a commanding presence,
  he shoulders the immense responsibility of safeguarding his people’s future
  while navigating fragile alliances with humans and other alien species.
  Haunted by the genocide of his homeworld and driven to prevent further
  atrocities, he balances strategic leadership with personal integrity, often
  putting his people’s needs before his own. Though outwardly serious and
  reserved, L’Forn’s moments of levity and combat prowess reveal a fierce,
  passionate side beneath the pressure of command.

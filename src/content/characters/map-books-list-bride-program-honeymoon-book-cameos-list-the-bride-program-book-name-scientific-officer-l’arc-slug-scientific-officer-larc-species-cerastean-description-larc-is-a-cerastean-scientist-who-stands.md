name: Scientific Officer Lâ€™Arc
slug: scientific-officer-larc
description: L'Arc is a Cerastean scientist who stands out among his people with
  his entirely golden coloring - from his tawny hair and honey-colored eyes with
  slit pupils to his golden-tan scales. At around 6 feet tall, he's considered
  short for a Cerastean, which has caused him some insecurity. His long silky
  hair drapes over his shoulders, and he has four-inch white horns rising
  straight from his temples. L'Arc has a more human-like appearance than most
  Cerasteans, with softer, narrower features rather than the pronounced
  cheekbones typical of his species. His analytical mind serves him well in his
  research on dulcis cloaking abilities, but he applies that same methodical
  approach to understanding and pleasing Laney. Originally shy and nervous
  around her, he's become confident and attentive as a mate, cataloguing every
  preference and response to become an expert on her pleasure. He's utterly
  devoted to Laney, fascinated by her freckles, and finds joy in the smallest
  gestures like carrying her everywhere and spoiling her completely.

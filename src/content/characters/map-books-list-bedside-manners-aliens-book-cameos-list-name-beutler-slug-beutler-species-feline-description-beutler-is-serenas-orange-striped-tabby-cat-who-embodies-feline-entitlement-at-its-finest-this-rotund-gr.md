name: Beutler
slug: beutler
description: Beutler is Serena's orange-striped tabby cat who embodies feline
  entitlement at its finest. This rotund, grumpy ball of fluff barely tolerates
  his owner while simultaneously demanding her constant attention and the finest
  delicacies (preferably from her plate). Despite his royal attitude and
  disdainful sniffs, Beutler shows surprising adaptability - eventually warming
  up to L'Vect enough to drape himself across the alien's shoulders like a furry
  scarf. Named after the pioneering hematologist Dr. Ernest Beutler, this
  "shameless brat" serves as both comic relief and a surprising bridge between
  species, proving that even the most finicky cats can find common ground with
  seven-foot-tall alien warriors. His loud complaints, selective affection, and
  general air of superiority make him the perfect embodiment of feline audacity.

name: Janet Olsen
slug: janet-olsen
description: Janet Olsen is a 28-year-old blonde, curvy nurse working at the
  Deerfield Medical Facility who lives up to her self-proclaimed title as the
  "gossip queen." Despite her love for juicy details and drama, she's
  fundamentally good-hearted and genuinely cares about her patients, often going
  above and beyond official protocols to ensure their comfort and well-being.
  Janet is warm, flirtatious, and has no filter when she's had a few drinks, but
  she's also professional, compassionate, and fiercely loyal to those she cares
  about. Her gossipy nature actually serves her well in forming connections with
  both patients and colleagues, and she has an intuitive ability to read people
  and situations.

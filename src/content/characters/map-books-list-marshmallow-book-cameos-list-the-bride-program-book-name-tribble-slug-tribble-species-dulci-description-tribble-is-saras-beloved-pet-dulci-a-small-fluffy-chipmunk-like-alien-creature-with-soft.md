name: Tribble
slug: tribble
description: Tribble is Sara's beloved pet dulci - a small, fluffy,
  chipmunk-like alien creature with soft blue fur. Sara "liberated" him on her
  first day aboard the Cerastean mothership during what became known as the
  "Dulci Liberation Incident," when several dulcis escaped from their laboratory
  cage. While the other dulcis scattered chaotically, Tribble calmly walked up
  to Sara and sat at her feet, seeming to sense her need for companionship. Sara
  quickly hid him in her shirt and has kept him as her constant companion ever
  since. Named after the fuzzy creatures from Star Trek, Tribble serves as
  Sara's emotional support, often nestling in the large pocket of her favorite
  hoodie or creating cozy nests in dresser drawers. He's described as spoiled
  and lazy, having adapted well to pet life rather than his original laboratory
  environment. Tribble provides Sara with unconditional love and comfort during
  her most vulnerable moments, and his presence represents her capacity for
  nurturing and forming bonds despite her traumatic past. His gentle, intuitive
  nature mirrors Sara's own quiet wisdom and ability to sense what others need.

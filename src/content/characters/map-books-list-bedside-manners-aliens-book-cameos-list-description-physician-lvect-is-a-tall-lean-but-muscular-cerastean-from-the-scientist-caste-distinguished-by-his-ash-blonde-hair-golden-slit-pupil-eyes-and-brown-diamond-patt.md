name: Physician L'Vect
slug: physician-lvect
description: Physician L'Vect is a tall, lean but muscular Cerastean from the
  Scientist caste, distinguished by his ash blonde hair, golden slit-pupil eyes,
  and brown diamond-patterned scales running down his face and neck. He has
  three-inch keratin horns rising from his temples and possesses the typical
  Cerastean enhanced senses, including a forked tongue that allows him to detect
  human emotions through scent. Highly intelligent and analytical, L'Vect
  struggles significantly with social interactions and understanding human
  behavior - he's described as socially inept even among his own people. His
  bedside manner is initially terrible, as he tends to be blunt, doesn't make
  eye contact, and fails to pick up on basic social cues. Despite his
  awkwardness, he's dedicated to his work and genuinely wants to help patients.
  L'Vect has a scientific fascination with animal biology and approaches the
  world through a purely analytical lens. Though he considers himself one of the
  "less desirable" males among Cerasteans due to his social difficulties, he's
  actually kind-hearted and capable of deep love once he finds someone who
  understands and accepts him.

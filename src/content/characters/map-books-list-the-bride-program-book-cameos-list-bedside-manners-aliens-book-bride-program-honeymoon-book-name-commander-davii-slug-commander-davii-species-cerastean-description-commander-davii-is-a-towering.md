name: Commander D'Avii
slug: commander-davii
description: Commander D'Avii is a towering Cerastean Warrior who stands well
  over 6 feet tall with a powerfully muscled, imposing physique that commands
  respect. His skin is covered in seamless tan and brown diamond-patterned
  scales that extend across his massive chest, arms, and even his mouth, with
  small horns rising above each temple nestled in his silver-white hair. His
  most striking features are his mesmerizing golden eyes with slit pupils that
  seem to glow with amber and blonde tones, and his forked tongue that he uses
  to sample scents and emotions. Despite his intimidating appearance, D'Avii is
  remarkably gentle and patient, especially when training younger warriors or
  interacting with humans. He's intellectually curious about human culture and
  language, methodically documenting everything in his beloved reports, and has
  developed an endearing attachment to coffee (despite hating the taste) simply
  because it gives him excuses to spend time with Maya. Though quiet and
  reserved by nature, he's deeply protective and yearns for the family bond he
  lost when his planet was destroyed. His formal, duty-bound exterior masks a
  passionate heart that becomes completely devoted once he allows himself to
  love, making him both a fierce warrior and a tender mate who would do anything
  to protect those he cares about.

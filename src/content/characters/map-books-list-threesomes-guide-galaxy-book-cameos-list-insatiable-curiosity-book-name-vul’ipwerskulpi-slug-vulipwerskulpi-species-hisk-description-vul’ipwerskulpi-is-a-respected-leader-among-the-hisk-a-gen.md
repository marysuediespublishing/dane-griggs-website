description: Vul’ipwerskulpi is a respected leader among the Hisk, a gentle and
  nomadic alien people whose appearance blends the massive, fur-covered form of
  a woolly mammoth with the strong, agile upper body of a centaur. Known for his
  wisdom and calm presence, he embodies the Hisk’s values of harmony, mutual
  aid, and peaceful coexistence. Though physically imposing, Vul’ipwerskulpi’s
  demeanor is measured and compassionate, earning him trust both within his
  tribe and from outsiders. As a leader, he navigates challenges with patience
  and empathy, guiding his people while maintaining the Hisk tradition of
  traveling lightly upon the worlds they visit.

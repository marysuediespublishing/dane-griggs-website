name: Scout Pilot D'Rett
slug: scout-pilot-drett
description: D'Rett is a massive Cerastean warrior who serves as a scout pilot,
  specializing as a skilled machinist in fixing and maintaining spacecraft.
  Described as a "gentle giant" and "beefcake," he's thicker and more
  barrel-chested than his nest-bonded partner L'Tarne, with silver-blonde hair,
  bold facial features, and slightly larger scales that give him an imposing
  physical presence. Despite his intimidating size and warrior caste status,
  D'Rett has a thoughtful, pragmatic nature and serves as the steady anchor for
  his more impulsive companions - he's the "safe harbor" that protects and
  indulges L'Tarne and Chelsea's shenanigans. Though he secretly shares
  L'Tarne's love of romantic comedies, D'Rett is more reserved and
  self-doubting, particularly about his lower caste status affecting their
  mating prospects. His gentle demeanor, combined with his protective instincts
  and willingness to carry Chelsea on piggyback rides while patiently explaining
  ship mechanics, makes him the perfect counterbalance to L'Tarne's more
  outgoing personality. Like all Cerasteans, he has golden eyes with slit
  pupils, diamond-patterned scales, small horns, and a forked tongue.

name: Trinh Le
slug: trinh-le
description: Trinh Le is a vibrant, spirited 25-year-old Vietnamese woman who
  joined the Cerastean Bride Program after being cured of cancer. Having faced
  mortality, she lives by the philosophy that each day is a gift and refuses to
  waste a moment. She's naturally interfering and demanding, with a sharp tongue
  and zero patience for rules and regulations, which puts her constantly at odds
  with the rigid Program Director L'Corte - though she secretly enjoys their
  verbal sparring matches. Trinh has an eye for fashion and loves wearing high
  heels that confuse and fascinate the aliens, using her appearance as both
  armor and weapon. She's fiercely loyal to her friends, always ready to meddle
  in their love lives or organize grand events like wedding ceremonies. Despite
  her seemingly frivolous exterior focused on designer clothes and parties,
  Trinh possesses remarkable emotional intelligence and leadership skills, often
  seeing solutions others miss and rallying people together when they need it
  most. Her black hair is growing back after chemotherapy, and she's learned to
  embrace both her vulnerability and her strength.

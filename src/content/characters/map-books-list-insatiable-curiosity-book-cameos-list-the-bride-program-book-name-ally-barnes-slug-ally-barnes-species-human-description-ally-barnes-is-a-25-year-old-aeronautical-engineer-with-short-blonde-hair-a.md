name: Ally Barnes
slug: ally-barnes
description: Ally Barnes is a 25-year-old aeronautical engineer with short
  blonde hair and distinctive horn-rimmed glasses that she loves despite
  thinking they make her look more like a "mousy preschool teacher" than the
  "naughty librarian" she'd hoped for. Passionate about space exploration since
  second grade, she joined the Cerastean Bride Program not for romance, but to
  fulfill her lifelong dream of becoming an astronaut after being rejected by
  NASA due to her keratoconus eye condition. Ally is brilliant, endlessly
  curious, and has an "insatiable curiosity" that often gets her into trouble -
  she's notorious for sneaking into restricted areas to explore technology and
  ask endless questions. She's socially awkward, tends to leave projects
  scattered everywhere, and voices her thoughts out loud without realizing it.
  Despite considering herself "not girlfriend material" and being inexperienced
  romantically, Ally forms deep friendships with her fellow bride volunteers and
  eventually finds love with her Cerastean work partner L'Zaen, who appreciates
  her intelligence and adventurous spirit.

name: General D'Annon
slug: general-dannon
description: General D'Annon is a formidable Cerastean warrior who appears
  intimidating with his enormous size, jagged facial scar running from the base
  of one horn through his eyebrow to the corner of his mouth, and what Sara
  calls "Resting Murder Face." Despite his menacing appearance - described as
  looking like a mix between an old-school Viking and a deadly rattlesnake - he
  possesses a gentle, nurturing soul that Sara affectionately nicknames
  "Marshmallow" for his soft, gooey center. His golden eyes, white-blond hair,
  and diamond-patterned scales give him an alien beauty, while his protective
  instincts and unwavering devotion make him a natural caretaker. D'Annon has
  been quietly watching over Sara since her first day on the ship, providing her
  with supplies and ensuring her comfort from afar. His scar came from an acid
  burn while protecting a scientist from a dangerous alien creature, and though
  he considers having it removed, Sara loves it as part of who he is. Highly
  observant and methodical, D'Annon balances his military duties with an almost
  reverent care for Sara, always putting her needs first and proving that
  beneath his warrior exterior lies a romantic heart capable of profound love
  and tenderness.

description: Lieutenant Zoe Shults - call sign “ABF” for Active Bitch Face - is
  one of only two female fighter pilots aboard the Cerastean mothership and a
  fiercely determined Air Force officer who refuses to let anything stand
  between her and the cockpit. Skilled, confident, and unafraid to challenge
  anyone who underestimates her, Zoe thrives under pressure and adapts quickly
  to new challenges, from mastering alien fighter darts to holding her own in
  hand-to-hand combat against larger opponents. Her sharp wit and unapologetic
  toughness earn her respect among her peers, while her deep love of flying
  drives her to push boundaries and prove she belongs in the skies - no matter
  the odds.

name: Lilith Blackwell
slug: lilith-blackwell
description: Lily is a 29-year-old nurse seeking a fresh start after ending a
  draining relationship with her manipulative ex, Marcus. Practical,
  independent, and a bit of a homebody, she’s not the type to chase adventures -
  preferring books, quiet, and stability - yet she has a wry sense of humor and
  a strong, nurturing streak, especially toward her beloved cat, Mango. She’s
  still carrying the emotional weight of past losses, including the death of her
  parents, and deeply values the support of her vibrant, free-spirited Aunt
  Zizi, who took her in as a teen. Though cautious and wary of romantic
  entanglements, Lily is curious and observant, with an underlying longing for
  genuine passion and connection that she’s not quite ready to admit - until the
  strange, alluring small town of Lublin Harbor begins to test her resolve.

name: Rose Ashford
slug: rose-ashford
description: Rose Ashford is a talented graphic artist and painter from the
  desert Southwest, craving a change of scenery and fresh inspiration. Warm,
  curious, and a little worn down from overwork, she jumps at the chance to
  spend two weeks in the coastal town of Lublin Harbor, splitting her time
  between outdoor adventures and creating art. She’s passionate about capturing
  landscapes and seascapes - especially lighthouses - in her work, and carries a
  personal connection to the Cape Vesna lighthouse through a tattoo inspired by
  her late mother. Rose is openhearted, observant, and eager to immerse herself
  in new experiences, whether it’s kayaking along rocky shores, sketching hidden
  coves, or simply breathing in the salty air.

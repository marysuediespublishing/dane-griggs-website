name: Ravok
slug: ravok
description: Ravok is a towering Cryzorian warrior - broad, powerful, and bred
  for battle - whose gleaming dark-gray skin and glowing white eyes give him an
  otherworldly, intimidating presence. Captured and imprisoned by humans after a
  crash, he endures their experiments with cold, calculating patience while his
  nanites heal his injuries and neutralize their drugs. Fiercely proud and
  unyielding, he views his captors with contempt, relishing the moment he can
  turn the tables with lethal precision. Beneath his warrior discipline burns a
  relentless drive for freedom and the certainty that his people will one day
  descend upon Earth, claiming it under the heel of Cryzorâ€™s dominance.

description: Sara Landry is a 26-year-old woman with medium-length brown hair
  who appears small and fragile but possesses remarkable inner strength.
  Extremely quiet and introverted by nature, she joined the Cerastean Bride
  Program not to find a mate, but as a hiding place from her abusive
  ex-boyfriend Carl. Despite her shy demeanor and preference for staying in the
  background, Sara is highly observant, intelligent, and resourceful - qualities
  that make her the de facto leader of the "Dulci Liberation Front" among her
  fellow bride volunteers. She has a deep love for reading and finds comfort in
  oversized hoodies. Sara struggles with trust issues and self-doubt due to her
  traumatic past, but beneath her fearful exterior lies a brave, stubborn woman
  capable of extraordinary courage when protecting those she loves. Her pet
  dulci Tribble serves as both companion and emotional support, representing her
  capacity for nurturing despite her own wounds. Throughout her journey, Sara
  evolves from a woman defined by fear and survival into someone who embraces
  love, trust, and her own worth.

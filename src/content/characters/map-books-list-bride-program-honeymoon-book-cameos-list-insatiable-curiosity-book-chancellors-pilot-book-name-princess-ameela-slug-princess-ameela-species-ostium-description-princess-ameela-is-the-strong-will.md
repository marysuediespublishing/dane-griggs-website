name: Princess Ameela
slug: princess-ameela
description: Princess Ameela is the strong-willed daughter of Queen Diamalla,
  determined to end her mother’s brutal rule. Intelligent, passionate, and
  courageous, she carries herself with the poise of royalty but refuses to be
  bound by the cruelty and oppression that define her mother’s reign. Ameela is
  driven by a deep sense of justice and loyalty to her people, willing to risk
  her own safety to protect others and work toward a better future for her
  kingdom. Her defiance of Diamalla’s tyranny is as much a personal mission as
  it is a political one, fueled by both moral conviction and a desire to break
  free from her mother’s shadow.

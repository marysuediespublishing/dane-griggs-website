name: Wilson
slug: wilson
description: Wilson is a small, fluffy alien creature that resembles a squirrel
  and possesses remarkable camouflage abilities, able to blend seamlessly into
  her surroundings. She's highly intelligent and seems to understand Chelsea's
  words, often chittering in response and serving as an excellent lookout during
  their nighttime scavenging missions on the Ostium space station. Wilson is
  extremely agile and playful, leaping between people's shoulders, diving
  through thick fur, and performing acrobatic catches when treats are tossed in
  the air. She has a strong bond with Chelsea, often perching on her shoulder or
  hiding in her shirt pocket, and appears to sense Chelsea's emotional state,
  providing comfort when needed. Originally from the jungle planet Xerini,
  Wilson was rescued by Chelsea from Dr. Evil's cruel experiments and has since
  become not just a beloved companion but a crucial ally in their survival.

slug: liaison-rosie-simpson
description: Rosie Simpson, in her late forties, serves as the warm yet capable
  liaison between the Cerasteans and the human bride volunteers. With a
  dignified presence and a nurturing spirit, she guides newcomers through the
  cultural and emotional adjustments of life aboard the mothership, ensuring
  they feel supported and understood. Often described as a den mother, Rosie has
  an instinct for when to offer a firm word, a listening ear, or a gentle nudge
  in the right direction. Her close partnership with Lâ€™Corte allows her to
  bridge communication gaps and smooth over tensions, making her an
  indispensable figure in fostering trust and cooperation between the two
  worlds.

slug: durrescope
description: Durrescope, the son of Vul’ipwerskulpi, serves as the Hisk’s
  diplomatic bridge to the Cerasteans and the human race. Tasked with forging a
  lasting alliance between Earth and his people, he blends his father’s calm
  wisdom with his own keen sense of diplomacy. Though youthful compared to other
  Hisk leaders, Durrescope’s approachable demeanor and genuine curiosity make
  him well-suited for cross-cultural negotiations. He navigates the complexities
  of interspecies politics with patience, respect, and an earnest desire to
  create mutual understanding, always mindful of the trust placed in him by both
  his father and his people.

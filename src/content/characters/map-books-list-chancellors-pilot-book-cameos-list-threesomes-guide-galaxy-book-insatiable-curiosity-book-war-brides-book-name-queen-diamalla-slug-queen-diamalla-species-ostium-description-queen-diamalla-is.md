name: Queen Diamalla
slug: queen-diamalla
description: Queen Diamalla is a cunning and ruthless ruler whose reign is
  marked by fear, manipulation, and an unyielding grip on power. Regal in
  bearing but cold in heart, she commands absolute loyalty from those around her
  - often through intimidation rather than respect. Her strategic mind and
  political acumen make her a formidable force, yet her ambition is tainted by
  cruelty, using oppression and violence to maintain control over her people.
  While she presents herself as the ultimate guardian of her realm, Diamallaâ€™s
  methods reveal a deep mistrust of others and a willingness to sacrifice
  anyone, even family, to preserve her throne.

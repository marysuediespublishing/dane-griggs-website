slug: chelsea-barrison
description: Chelsea Barrison is a 25-year-old free-spirited adventurer with an
  infectious enthusiasm for life that remains unbroken despite months of
  captivity. Petite with blonde hair often worn in braids, deep blue eyes, and
  an elfin face with a pointy chin, she's a former college dropout who chose
  travel over conventional life, funding her motorcycle journeys across America
  through odd jobs while dreaming of YouTube stardom. Her quick wit, irreverent
  sense of humor, and tendency to quote movies make her both endearing and
  exasperating - she's self-aware enough to know she can be "a pain in the ass."
  Despite her small stature, Chelsea possesses remarkable resilience,
  resourcefulness, and courage, having survived months alone on an alien space
  station through stealth and sabotage. Her wanderlust and philosophy that "home
  is where the heart is" ultimately lead her to choose a life among the stars
  with her alien mates rather than returning to her old existence on Earth.

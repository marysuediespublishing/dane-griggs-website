name: Maya Arnold
slug: maya-arnold
description: Maya Arnold is a 23-year-old woman with long, light-brown hair,
  hazel eyes flecked with green, and a medium height and build around 5'8".
  She's naturally beautiful with freckled cheeks like her mother, and often
  favors colorful, flowing clothing or comfortable jeans over restrictive formal
  wear. Maya possesses a fierce, protective personality driven by unwavering
  loyalty to her family - she left college early to work as a medical
  transcriptionist and help care for her 12-year-old sister Tasha, who suffers
  from leukemia. She's brave yet practical, willing to sacrifice her own future
  by joining an alien bride program if it means saving Tasha's life. Maya is
  naturally curious and adventurous, has a good sense of humor, and forms deep
  friendships quickly. She's also refreshingly direct and honest in her
  relationships, unafraid to fight for what she wants - whether that's
  challenging alien social hierarchies or pursuing her feelings for D'Avii
  despite cultural barriers. Her core drive is love and protection of family,
  but she also craves genuine connection and isn't willing to settle for less
  than what her heart truly wants.

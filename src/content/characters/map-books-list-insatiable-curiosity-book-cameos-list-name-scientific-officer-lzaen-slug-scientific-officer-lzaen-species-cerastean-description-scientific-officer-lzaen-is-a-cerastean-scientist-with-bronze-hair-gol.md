name: Scientific Officer L'Zaen
slug: scientific-officer-lzaen
description: Scientific Officer L'Zaen is a Cerastean scientist with bronze
  hair, golden amber eyes with slit pupils, and shorter but thicker horns than
  most of his species. His chest and arms are covered in cream-colored scales
  with intricate caramel and chocolate diamond patterns. Initially assigned to
  be Ally's "babysitter" after she kept sneaking into the engine room, he
  becomes her devoted work partner and eventually her mate. L'Zaen is patient,
  kind, and genuinely appreciates Ally's intelligence and curiosity - traits
  that make him different from the human men who were intimidated by her
  intellect. He has a musical background, having almost chosen to be an Artist
  before becoming a Scientist, and treasures the guitar Ally gives him as a
  gift. Though he initially pursues a relationship with another bride volunteer
  named Krystal, he gradually realizes his true feelings for Ally. L'Zaen is
  protective, thoughtful, and finds Ally's endless enthusiasm and adventures
  both endearing and exciting. He's the perfect complement to Ally's chaotic
  energy, providing steady support while sharing her love of exploration and
  discovery.

name: Director L'Corte
slug: director-lcorte
description: Director L’Corte is the impeccably composed head of the Bride
  Program aboard the Cerastean ship B187, a man who prizes order, decorum, and
  adherence to protocol. His polished manners and occasionally condescending
  tone often clash with the unpredictable nature of the human women under his
  supervision - particularly Trinh, whose irreverence and penchant for high
  heels both exasperate and intrigue him. Though he outwardly maintains a
  dignified distance, L’Corte secretly relishes their verbal sparring matches,
  finding her challenges to his authority both maddening and oddly refreshing.
  Beneath his formal exterior lies a man amused - and perhaps a little enchanted
  - by the very chaos he claims to disdain.

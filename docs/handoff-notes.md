# Handoff Notes: UX Research & Sprint Planning

## 📋 Project Overview
Complete UX research and sprint planning for Dane Griggs sci-fi romance website, transitioning from existing Astro blog platform to full author marketing site.

## 🎯 Key Decisions & Rationale

### **Brand Direction**
- **Cosmic Theme**: Subtle space elements that enhance rather than compete with book covers
- **Color Psychology**: Deep Space Navy (authority), Cosmic Rose (romance), Stellar Gold (premium)
- **Typography Strategy**: Playfair Display for sophistication, Inter for optimal readability
- **"No Mary Sue" Promise**: Central to brand differentiation in saturated alien romance market

### **User Experience Strategy**
- **Mobile-First Design**: 70% of Facebook ad traffic is mobile, drives all design decisions
- **Conversion Optimization**: Multiple CTAs, social proof placement, friction reduction
- **Content Discovery**: Advanced filtering by alien species, heat level, series status
- **Performance Priority**: <2.5s LCP goal for Facebook ad landing optimization

### **Technical Architecture Decisions**
- **Astro + TypeScript**: Leverages existing foundation, optimal for static content + dynamic features
- **Component Reusability**: 80%+ reuse rate across pages to maximize development efficiency
- **Shared Mock Strategy**: Zero drift between unit/E2E tests using common mock contracts
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript for accessibility

## 🔍 Research Insights

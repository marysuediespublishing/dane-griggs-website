## Koko
Mokosh, a slavic goddess, based on the following description: Mokosh, known affectionately as Koko, is the warm and charismatic guardian goddess of Lublin Harbor, blending an air of approachable charm with an undercurrent of ancient power. In her human guise, she’s a tall, striking blonde with a ready smile, expressive eyes, and a playful, 1950s housewife aesthetic - often seen in colorful dresses and aprons embroidered with whimsical details like flowers and spiders. As the harbor’s protector, she uses her magic to shield its mystical residents from prying human eyes, subtly shaping the environment to suit her needs - like keeping the harbor waters comfortably warm. Koko thrives on fostering community, greeting newcomers with genuine hospitality, welcome baskets, and personal touches that make them feel at home, all while ensuring that they respect the town’s secrets and contribute to its well-being.
## Lily Blackwell
Lily is a 29-year-old nurse seeking a fresh start after ending a draining relationship with her manipulative ex. Practical, independent, and a bit of a homebody, she’s not the type to chase adventures - preferring books, quiet, and stability - yet she has a wry sense of humor and a strong, nurturing streak, especially toward her beloved cat, Mango. Lily is 29, with hazel eyes and a cascade of chestnut hair that can be wild and full. Her skin is naturally fair and she has an average build inherited from her mother, standing about 5'6".
## Rose Ashford
Rose Ashford is a short, curvy woman with big brown eyes and dark hair that catches auburn highlights in the sun. She often wears casual, comfortable clothes—like weathered cutoff jean shorts and a T-shirt—paired with a relaxed, approachable style. Her skin is adorned with meaningful ink, including an intricately detailed tattoo of the Cape Vesna lighthouse on her upper arm, its storm-tossed scene inspired by a beloved painting and tied to the memory of her late mother. When she moves, there’s an easy confidence in her posture, and her artist’s eye shows in the way she notices and reacts to the colors and textures around her. (ended up needing to make her less curvy then make her a little curvier and her hair a little shorter)
## Janet Olsen
Janet Olsen is a 28-year-old blonde, curvy nurse working at the Deerfield Medical Facility who lives up to her self-proclaimed title as the "gossip queen." Despite her love for juicy details and drama, she's fundamentally good-hearted and genuinely cares about her patients, often going above and beyond official protocols to ensure their comfort and well-being. Janet is warm, flirtatious, and has no filter when she's had a few drinks, but she's also professional, compassionate, and fiercely loyal to those she cares about. Her gossipy nature actually serves her well in forming connections with both patients and colleagues, and she has an intuitive ability to read people and situations.
## Herman Goldberg
Herman Goldberg is a spirited man in his eighties with a mischievous charm and an incorrigible flirtatious streak. A decorated war veteran in his 80s, he received life-saving treatment at the Deerfield Medical Facility, where he quickly became a favorite among staff and fellow patients alike. Herman’s wit and warmth make him a source of levity even in the most serious moments - whether he’s teasing Serena with marriage proposals, charming nurses, or offering playful banter to anyone who visits. His resilience, humor, and zest for connection embody the hope and joy to their patients. (an you have him holding a cane instead of being in a wheelchair. also remove the second person. can you make his hair a little thinner and make him thinner as well)
## Beutler

## Princess Ameela
I want to create an image for an alien species. this is the description: Ameela is a petite, gray-skinned Ostium with a faint lavender cast to her skin, long silver hair, and delicate, gossamer wings like a dragonfly’s. Her eyes are pure silver with no visible pupils. Her arms carry bioluminescent “luxen” grooves that shift with emotion—muted green when she’s afraid, and blue when she’s sad—and she seems to have good control over them. She’s described as very small/petite, and her wings look too fine to truly carry her in flight. When the group meets her, she wears a simple light-blue sleeveless dress and a minimal ringed necklace (no crown or heavy jewelry). (can you create one that is photo realistic?)
## Queen Diamalla
now can you create one that is the above character's mother. She is a queen so she needs to be wearing something royal and a crown
## Male Ostium
I would like a male of this alien species. No hair and no wings, and have the bioluminescent "luxen" grooves be red for this one
## Laney Calhoun
Laney Calhoun is a 28-year-old paralegal with vibrant red curly hair, freckles scattered across her pale skin, and warm brown eyes. Standing at 5'10", she's tall for a human woman with a confident, curvy figure that she's learned to embrace. After her ex-fiancé Ben's betrayal just a month before their wedding, Laney's self-esteem took a hit, but joining the Bride Program has helped her rediscover her worth. She's naturally witty and uses humor when feeling vulnerable, has a tendency to be bossy (especially in bed), and possesses a resilient spirit that shines through during crises. Though she prefers "glamping" to roughing it and loves being spoiled by her mate L'Arc, she proves surprisingly resourceful and determined when faced with challenges. Her freckles, which she once considered a flaw, have become one of L'Arc's favorite features, and she's learned to see herself through his adoring eyes as the beautiful, strong woman she truly is.
## Zoe Shults
Lieutenant Zoe Shults - call sign “ABF” for Active Bitch Face - is one of only two female fighter pilots aboard the Cerastean mothership and a fiercely determined Air Force officer who refuses to let anything stand between her and the cockpit. Skilled, confident, and unafraid to challenge anyone who underestimates her, Zoe thrives under pressure and adapts quickly to new challenges, from mastering alien fighter darts to holding her own in hand-to-hand combat against larger opponents. Her sharp wit and unapologetic toughness earn her respect among her peers, while her deep love of flying drives her to push boundaries and prove she belongs in the skies - no matter the odds. (can you remove the active bitch face patch from her outfit and make her leaner)
## Ally Barnes
Ally Barnes is a 25-year-old aeronautical engineer with short blonde hair and distinctive horn-rimmed glasses that she loves despite thinking they make her look more like a "mousy preschool teacher" than the "naughty librarian" she'd hoped for. Passionate about space exploration since second grade, she joined the Cerastean Bride Program not for romance, but to fulfill her lifelong dream of becoming an astronaut after being rejected by NASA due to her keratoconus eye condition. Ally is brilliant, endlessly curious, and has an "insatiable curiosity" that often gets her into trouble - she's notorious for sneaking into restricted areas to explore technology and ask endless questions. She's socially awkward, tends to leave projects scattered everywhere, and voices her thoughts out loud without realizing it. Despite considering herself "not girlfriend material" and being inexperienced romantically, Ally forms deep friendships with her fellow bride volunteers and eventually finds love with her Cerastean work partner L'Zaen, who appreciates her intelligence and adventurous spirit.
## Hisk
I have an alien species I want to create. This is their description: The Hisk are described as gentle, nomadic aliens resembling a cross between a woolly mammoth and a centaur. They have a massive, fur-covered body with four sturdy legs and a face similar to a camel, evoking the imposing presence of prehistoric megafauna. Their upper torso is more humanoid in structure, allowing for expressive gestures and the carrying of tools or weapons when necessary. They have furry, shaggy arms that end in 3 fingered hands. Despite their formidable size and strength, the Hisk are known for their calm, diplomatic nature and a deep cultural emphasis on cooperation and alliance-building.
## Rosie Simpson
can you create a female character based on the following description: Rosie Simpson is a black woman, in her late forties, serves as the warm yet capable liaison between the Cerasteans and the human bride volunteers. With a dignified presence and a nurturing spirit, she guides newcomers through the cultural and emotional adjustments of life aboard the mothership, ensuring they feel supported and understood. Often described as a den mother, Rosie has an instinct for when to offer a firm word, a listening ear, or a gentle nudge in the right direction. She has closely cropped natural hair with gray at her temples, dressed in a casual business suit.

Have clothes be a dirty-ish overall like a mechanic wears and have her with a large pipe wrench propped on her shoulder.
